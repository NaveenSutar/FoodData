          "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged a group of African leaders to ask Vladimir Putin to free political prisoners.\n\nThe presidents of Zambia, Senegal, Comoros, South Africa and Egypt's prime minister are there, alongside senior officials from Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville.\n\nThey are expected to travel to Russia for a meeting with President Putin on Saturday in St Petersburg.\n\nMissile attack on Kyiv is 'message to Africa' - Ukraine war latest\n\nAfter meeting the delegation, Mr Zelenskyy reiterated that peace talks would only be possible when Russia pulls out of occupied areas.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the leaders were \"here to share the African perspective\" as he urged a de-escalation on both sides and said the sovereignty of countries should be respected.\n\nThe mission to Ukraine, the first of its kind by African leaders, comes in the wake of other peace initiatives such as one by China, and it carried extra importance for the African countries, as they rely in varying degrees on food and fertiliser deliveries from Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"This conflict is affecting Africa negatively,\" Mr Ramaphosa said at a news conference alongside Mr Zelenskyy and the four other African heads of state or government, after the leaders met for closed-door talks on Friday afternoon.\n\nHe and others acknowledged the intensity of the fight and the animosity between Russia and Ukraine, but insisted all wars must come to an end - and that the delegation wants to help expedite that.\n\n\"I do believe that Ukrainians feel that they must fight and not give up. The road to peace is very hard,\" Mr Ramaphosa said, adding that \"there is a need to bring this conflict to an end sooner rather than later\".\n\nHe also called for more prisoner swaps and said displaced children should be returned to their homes.\n\nMany African nations have long had close ties with Moscow, dating back to the Cold War when the Soviet Union supported their anti-colonial struggles.\n\nSouth Africa, Senegal and Uganda have avoided censuring Moscow for the conflict, while Egypt, Zambia and Comoros voted against Russia last year in a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Moscow's invasion.\n\nThe mood of the news conference soured when Comoros President Azali Assoumani floated the idea of a \"road map\" to peace, prompting questions from Mr Zelenskyy who sought a clarification and insisted he did not want \"any surprises\" from their visit to Mr Putin.\n\nMr Zelenskyy then urged them to help free political prisoners from Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\n\"Would you please ask Russia to liberate the political prisoners?\" Mr Zelenskyy said. \"Maybe this will be an important result of your mission, of your 'road map'.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president expressed some frustration about their trip St Petersburg, saying they would have \"conversations with the terrorists\" on Saturday.\n\nHowever, he added that he wanted to hold a Ukraine-Africa summit and hoped to have closer relations with the continent.\n\nEarlier, the delegation placed candles at a mass grave near St Andrew's Church in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv.\n\nBucha is the site of one of the worst-known massacres of the war, with Russian troops killing hundreds of civilians there last year.\n\nAn air raid siren also rang out during the group's visit to Kyiv and Mayor Vitali Klitschko said an explosion had been reported in the Podilskiy district.\n\n\"Russian missiles are a message to Africa: Russia wants more war, not peace,\" tweeted Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it downed six Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, six Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles and two reconnaissance drones - but did not say where they were destroyed.\n\nPeace is not the only matter on the agenda for the African leaders, however.\n\nOfficials also want to examine how Russia can be paid for fertiliser exports it desperately needs - despite sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThey are also looking at getting more vital grain shipments out of Ukraine.\n\nMr Ramaphosa said after his meeting with Mr Zelenskyy that there should be an opening up of logistics for both grain and fertiliser.\n\nThe delegation appear to have split allegiances, however.\n\nSouth Africa, Senegal and Uganda have avoided criticising Moscow; while Zambia, Egypt and Comoros last year voted against Russia in a UN resolution condemning the invasion.\n\n\"Life is universal, and we must protect lives - Ukrainian lives, Russian lives, global lives,\" said Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema on the Ukraine visit.\n\n\"Instability anywhere is instability everywhere.\"",

          "title": "Heather Mack, convicted in Bali of killing mom and stuffing body in suitcase, pleads guilty in U.S.",
          "body": "CHICAGO -- An American woman accused of helping to kill her mother and stuffing her body in a suitcase during a luxury vacation to Bali nine years ago changed her plea to guilty in Chicago federal court on Friday. Her lawyer said later she hoped to avoid a sentence of life behind bars by doing so.\n\nHeather Mack pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to kill Sheila von Wiese-Mack with her then-boyfriend to get access to a $1.5 million trust fund. Mack, then 18 and pregnant, covered her mom's mouth in a hotel room while Tommy Schaefer bludgeoned her with a fruit bowl, prosecutors say.\n\nThe change-of-plea hearing is the latest chapter in a story that has garnered international attention in part because of photographs of the suitcase, which seemed too small to hold an adult woman's body.\n\nMack, now 27, appeared calm and confident as she stood in orange jail garb and orange slippers, occasionally brushing her hair from her eyes as she answered the judge's questions -- saying she knew she was giving up her right to remain silent at the hearing.\n\nAfter Mack paused before saying she understood the plea agreement hammered out with prosecutors in preceding weeks, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly noted the hesitation and asked again if she was sure she fully understood it.\n\n\"Yes, your honor,\" she responded.\n\nTwo other charges against Mack would be dropped at the end of the sentencing process. Schaefer was convicted of murder and remains in Indonesia, where he is serving an 18-year sentence. He is charged in the same U.S. indictment.\n\nAfter the hearing, relatives of Wiese-Mack issued a statement saying they were \"very relieved that the mastermind of Sheila's murder admitted her guilt today.\"\n\n\"We will continue to be our sister Sheila's voice throughout the sentencing process to ensure that real justice is served,\" they said.\n\nThe plea agreement calls for a sentence of no more than 28 years, though Kennelly told Mack he hasn't yet decided whether to accept that sentencing cap. If he rejects it, Mack could withdraw her plea, and either hold fresh plea discussions or go to trial. The judge set a Dec. 18 sentencing date.\n\nA key issue that wasn't decided in talks between prosecutors and the defense prior to Friday's hearing was whether the years Mack spent in prison in Indonesia for a 2015 conviction of being an accessory to Wiese-Mack's murder would be subtracted from whatever U.S. sentence is imposed by Kennelly.\n\nMack, who lived with her mother in suburban Chicago's Oak Park, served seven years of her 10-year Indonesian sentence. She was deported in 2021 and U.S. agents arrested her immediately after her plane landed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.\n\nMack's lawyer, Michael Leonard, told reporters after the hearing that his client's decision to plead guilty was motivated in part by wanting to avoid a sentence of life in prison -- something that would be off the table under the plea deal, if the judge formally OKs it.\n\nIn arguing for leniency at sentencing, Leonard said he would present evidence that Mack has matured and that she was \"a fantastic mother\" to her and Schaefer's daughter, who she gave birth to in Indonesia after her arrest.\n\n\"She is certainly not the person she was,\" Leonard said. \"She has grown as a human.\"\n\nHer then-six-year-old daughter was with her when Mack was arrested at the Chicago airport. The girl was later placed with a relative after a custody fight.\n\nLeonard said Mack was able to spend time with her daughter while serving her sentence in Indonesia and that her child was now her top priority.\n\n\"The most important thing for her is reunification with her daughter,\" he said.\n\nIn successfully arguing against bond for Mack in 2021, prosecutors said she and Schaefer had planned the killing for months. They also said they had video evidence that showed both Mack and Schaefer trying to get the suitcase with Wiese-Mack's body inside it into an Indonesian taxicab.\n\nSome relatives of Wiese-Mack had complained that the Indonesian sentence was far too lenient. In filings, prosecutors said the U.S. charges don't violate constitutional prohibitions against prosecuting someone twice for the same acts, including because the U.S. charges allege conspiracy and other acts not included in the Indonesian case.",

          "title": "With Ja Morant suspended, so are Grizzlies' plans for NBA title chase",
          "body": "Ja Morant's immense basketball talents have transformed the Memphis Grizzlies into NBA title contenders\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies put their future and title hopes in the hands of Ja Morant.\n\nWith Morant suspended, so are the franchise's championship plans.\n\nThe NBA has sidelined Morant for the first 25 games of the upcoming season. The suspension Friday of Memphis' franchise player was not unexpected for an organization that has made headlines for players' off-court issues and on-court antics.\n\nThe association still is a league where the best players matter.\n\nJeff Van Gundy, the former NBA coach and current ESPN and ABC analyst, said there are lot of questions about how much the Grizzlies will matter without their best player.\n\n\"Are they healthy? Are they unselfish? Are they driven? And can they make enough right decisions to lead an organization?\" said Van Gundy, who believes Memphis has strong leadership in general manager Zach Kleiman and an outstanding coaching staff led by Taylor Jenkins.\n\nBut Van Gundy added everything centers around their point guard and that \"hopefully for Morant ... he makes the right choices.\"\n\nHe has shown he can on the court.\n\nMorant has been the Grizzlies' biggest star; he was their first NBA Rookie of the Year in 2020 and the 2022 NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year. His No. 12 jersey ranked among the NBA's top 10 best sellers on the league website the second half of this season, and Nike gave Morant a signature shoe deal.\n\nOff the court, there has been a slew of questionable decisions.\n\nMorant, 23, flashed a handgun not once, but twice between March 4 and May 13 all caught on social media video. The second came after an eight-game suspension in March that allowed Morant to be back for the playoffs.\n\nPart of Morant's latest punishment is dealing with what Commissioner Adam Silver called \"destructive behavior.\" The Grizzlies issued a terse statement, noting all team personnel are expected to follow NBA and Memphis standards.\n\nWith Morant leading the way, Memphis has had regular season success but mostly playoff disappointment for fans and the organization.\n\nThey were good enough to be the Western Conference's No. 2 seed the past two postseasons with only playoff series win. They lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round in April.\n\nNow what the team will look like by the time next season comes around is unclear.\n\nThe Grizzlies have limited flexibility under the salary cap after doling out big contracts to Jaren Jackson Jr., this season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year, then Morant.\n\nThey do have the 25th pick overall in Thursday night's NBA draft, but Memphis already has decided not to bring back Dillon Brooks as a free agent after he led the league in technicals along with suspensions and fines. Brooks called LeBron James old as the Grizzlies lost in six games to the Lakers. Brooks was suspended for a game in the series and fined for not talking to the media.\n\nCenter Steven Adams never returned after hurting his right knee hurt in late January. Key reserve Brandon Clarke tore his left Achilles tendon March 3 -- hours before Morant earned his first suspension for livestreaming himself flashing a gun at a Denver-area strip club.\n\nBut because Morant has never played more than 67 games in a regular season, the Grizzlies do have experience playing without him.\n\nWith Morant, the Grizzlies are 142-106 (.573) in the regular season since he arrived in Memphis. They are 37-24 (.607) without him in the lineup.\n\nIronically, Morant missed 25 games during the 2021-22 season due to injuries and Memphis went 20-5.\n\nThis past season, however, the Grizzlies was just 11-10 without Morant and 40-21 with him.\n\nVan Gundy said Tyus Jones is a big reason Memphis has had success without Morant. With Jones under contract for the upcoming season, that's a bonus for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"He knows when Morant comes back he's the franchise player and so I don't think that'll be a problem,\" Van Gundy said of Jones' understanding he will be just be a part-time starter until the two-time All-Star's return.\n\nBut Jones, like everything about the Grizzlies at the moment, is just a temporary solution.\n\nTheir future hinges on Morant -- the point guard with \"otherwordly talent\" -- correcting his behavior and responsibly addressing issues away from basketball.\n\nVan Gundy said supporters are hoping for a good outcome, \"but the only one in charge of that is Morant.\"",

          "title": "Replacing the Capitalist Dream of AI-Driven Profits",
          "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and how it's going to change the world is a popular topic of conversation these days. There is concern that it will generate ever-more deceptive imagery that can upend people's lives or create propaganda that can fuel mass fear. There's the ultimate fear of human extinction from the increasingly sophisticated evolution of AI. These are valid worries.\n\nThen there's the seemingly more mundane threat that AI poses to employment. It is expressed in the form of countless stories that have some iteration of the headline: which jobs are at most risk of being lost to AI?\n\nMost analysts predict that AI will replace graphic designers, copywriters, customer service agents, and telemarketers. Some of the most dystopian of these listicles focus on teachers and psychologists being replaced by AI.\n\nThe stories are written with the intention of predicting the coming storm so that people can prepare themselves for the future. But the headlines are also intentionally designed as clickbait, likely fueling fear-based consumption of the stories by readers eager to find out if their own jobs are likely to be replaced by AI in the coming years. Indeed, I found several stories, like this one, where my own vocation of journalism was in the crosshairs of AI.\n\nThe framing of \"Will AI replace your job?\" obscures the bigger problem that has been at work for centuries: and that is how our jobs, and therefore our educations, careers, and livelihoods, are at the whims of a capitalist system intent on minimizing costs and maximizing profits.\n\nIndeed, Mathias Doepfner, the CEO of the German media group that owns Politico, who warned that AI could replace journalism jobs, used Darwinian logic in saying, \"Artificial intelligence has the potential to make independent journalism better than it ever was -- or simply replace it,\" and therefore, \"Only those [publishing houses] who create the best original content will survive.\"\n\nAnd while critics of AI counter that it could never replace humans because of our innate creativity and curiosity, the point that often gets missed is that humans are the ones engaging in the great AI replacement of jobs -- a small handful of humans. They hail from the rarified group of elites who sit in corporate board rooms and deliver presentations to shareholders about how they plan to maximize dividends by replacing humans with AI.\n\nThe question we should be asking isn't whether AI can replace humans. It should be: why are some humans so intent on replacing the jobs that the rest of us hold, with AI? Even further, why do we live in a world where we lack so much control over our destinies in the first place?\n\nAI, like other innovations that have automated jobs, is simply a tool that can make life easier. I can use a machine to wash my clothes and another one to wash my dishes instead of wasting my time with handwashing. Graphic designers already use software to digitally paint images instead of painting them by hand. If AI is a tool that can make certain jobs easier and free up our time for relaxation and leisure while we reap the same or greater compensation then so be it. But it ought not to be inevitable that corporate employers will cut our salaries or entirely replace our jobs with AI. That is a choice being made in a system that relies on profit motives rather than human well-being.\n\nWhat we consider a vocation, big business treats as a cog in a giant wheel called \"the labor market.\" Dire predictions of AI \"disruptions\" to this market cast the entire trend as almost a natural phenomenon, whose trajectory is simply out of human hands.\n\nBut the reason that AI is booming is because it translates into a giant windfall for corporations. One economic prediction concludes that \"the market for artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to show strong growth in the coming decade. Its value of nearly [$100 billion] is expected to grow twentyfold by 2030, up to nearly [$2 trillion].\"\n\nAI is big business, perhaps the biggest of them all. The dystopia it promises is a natural endpoint -- of unregulated capitalism. If the \"man behind the curtain\" is eager to replace us, why can we not rip the curtain down and replace him?\n\nSo, I asked ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot that is basically a smarter Google, the following question: \"Does a capitalist economic model center human [well-being]?\" The first sentence of a lengthy response was, \"The capitalist economic model, in its purest form, does not explicitly center human well-being as its primary objective.\"\n\nChatGPT proceeded to tell me that \"Capitalism emphasizes individual economic freedom and the pursuit of self-interest, with the belief that this leads to overall economic growth and prosperity.\"\n\n\"Belief\" is the operative word here. It is a matter of faith that capitalism leads to prosperity for all. There is a religious fervor that was once popularly called \"trickle-down economics,\" underpinning a system where reality is at odds with the fantasy of capitalist wealth sharing.\n\nWhen examining broad trends, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that wealth inequality in the U.S. grew significantly between 1979 and 2019. The CBO report, which is based on a nonpartisan analysis, concluded that \"Increases in market income at the top of the distribution drove much of the rise in income inequality over that time.\" In other words, the rich got richer because they hoarded more wealth.\n\nIt also found that \"transfers increasingly lessened income inequality when transfer rates grew among households in the lowest quintile.\" This technical language simply means that when people accessed government benefits their incomes increased. It's like saying, \"People benefitted when given benefits.\"\n\nThere is no need for belief or faith in a system where the government is designed to directly help the people it represents. Belief and faith are required only to prop up the great lie that a capitalist economy helps everyone prosper. If we want people to prosper, we can make it so. There are many forms this can take: renewing the child tax credit, replacing private health care with a tax-funded Medicare for All system, increasing Social Security benefits, paying reparations to Black people, and even guaranteeing a basic income. None of them rely on faith. They help people because they are designed to help people.\n\nI asked ChatGPT, \"What sort of economic system can replace capitalism and ensure the [well-being] and prosperity of the vast majority of humans?\" The machine spat out five different options ranging from socialism to a \"resource-based\" economy \"where the allocation of resources is based on careful assessment and sustainable management of Earth's resources.\"\n\nEven AI knows that there are alternatives to the current system that rules our lives. If capitalism can replace us, surely, we can replace capitalism?",

          "body": "PLAYING PS4 or PS5 games on your living room TV is great, but what if you could turn your phone into a handheld console and take all your games wherever you want?\n\nBackbone's latest mobile controller, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition, promises just that and more, and I tried it for a week to see if it delivers.\n\nWhen you open the box, you'll first see a card with a QR code to download the Backbone app on your phone before you even take the controller out.\n\nThe Backbone app is not required to use the device, but I strongly recommend you install it as it creates a very nice console-like experience and brings some important features.\n\nIt will help you discover new games to play and keep everything in one place, and on Android, the app is free right now, but an upcoming Backbone+ subscription will be adding more features.\n\nAnother reason to have the app installed are features like taking screenshots, capturing gameplay and, more importantly, setting up a quick shortcut to PS Remote Play.\n\nThis particular Backbone One version is an officially licensed product for PlayStation, so expect the build quality and design to match those of your PS5 console.\n\nInstead of a generic ABXY button layout, you have PlayStation's iconic triangle, circle, cross and square face buttons.\n\nThe buttons on the right side and the D-Pad on the left side have the same translucent design seen on the PS5's DualSense controller and you even get a PlayStation logo on the back.\n\nThe L1 and R1 buttons are clicky, and the L2 and R2 are actual analogue triggers with nice travel, while the two analogue sticks are clickable, so you can do L3 and R3.\n\nThe analogue stick layout is asymmetrical, though, which, together with the placement of the Options and Share buttons near the bottom, is a weird choice for an accessory aimed at PlayStation fans.\n\nAnother inconvenience is the lack of a button to press instead of the PlayStation's touchpad, so you'll have to tap twice on your phone's screen to bring up maps and other in-game menus.\n\nThe device feels sturdy and although the side controllers are roughly the size of Nintendo's Joy-con, they are much more comfortable to hold.\n\nThe Android version of the Backbone One PlayStation Edition supports almost any recent phone that runs Android 8.0 or later and has a USB-C connector.\n\nThe device stretches to accommodate a variety of phone sizes, and the protruding camera arrays found on modern phones shouldn't be a problem.\n\nI tested it with the mid-range mid-sized Samsung A53 5G and it fits securely, but it should work well with smaller phones and even larger ones, like Samsung's S23 Ultra.\n\nBecause the Backbone One connects directly to your phone via the USB-C port, there's virtually no input delay caused by the controller itself.\n\nWith the Backbone, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can plug in your favourite wired headset even if your phone doesn't have the audio port, which has become a rarity now.\n\nYou also get a passthrough USB Type-C port, which lets you charge your phone while playing or plug in a power bank for extended gaming sessions on the go.\n\nThe controller itself does not use any external power source or a battery, so it does not require charging - you just snap your phone in, and it always works.\n\nThe Backbone app I mentioned already brings a console-like interface to your phone, letting you launch games and cloud streaming services, watch trailers of upcoming games, and discover new games to play.\n\nThere's a dedicated orange button on the controller to launch the app, and you can set the ellipsis button to open the PS Remote Play with a double tap.\n\nYou can also record video captures and take screenshots of your gameplay as there's a dedicated button for this, too - a short press starts a recording, and a long press takes a screenshot.\n\nThe app also supports its own friends list with chat rooms, and lets you invite other players to a party or voice chat, but you can also use PlayStation's own chat and party features.\n\nBecause it's a PlayStation-themed accessory, you'll most likely use it to play games remotely from your PS4 or PS5, so you will need the free PS Remote Play app installed on your phone.\n\nPlaying PS4 and PS5 games remotely felt great with the controller, and any minor stuttering and input lag issues I experienced were due to internet connection hiccups rather than the Backbone itself.\n\nAs this Backbone One is a licensed PS product, the experience with the PS app was seamless and it automatically detected the controller and prompted me to start a remote play session.\n\nThe controller felt comfortable for extended periods of play and it registered my inputs flawlessly with no perceiveable latency.\n\nUnlike PlayStation's own upcoming handheld, Project Q, the Backbone One allows you to enjoy your PS games both via Wi-Fi and mobile internet, if you have unlimited data plan.\n\nThis means you can play both at home when your main screen is not available, or on the go wherever you are, as long as you have a stable internet connection.\n\nThe minimum recommended internet speed for PS Remote Play is 5Mbps for upload and download, but for the best performance, you need speeds of at least 15Mbps.\n\nDespite being clearly designed with PlayStation fans in mind, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition supports all other remote play and game streaming services and apps.\n\nThis means you can enjoy games installed on your PC via Steam Link, and games from your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One console via Xbox Remote Play.\n\nGames from cloud gaming services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now are also supported, provided you have a subscription for those services.\n\nOf course, you can also play any native mobile game that supports controllers and is installed locally on your phone, such as Diablo Immortal, Call of Duty Mobile, Brawlhalla and many more.\n\nThe controller's asking price of £99.99 is not cheap and rather in line with similar products, but this Backbone version is the only PlayStation-branded mobile controller right now.\n\nAlso, the Backbone One will certainly be the cheaper option to PlayStation's upcoming Project Q, as it doesn't have its own screen, but will let you play over both Wi-Fi and mobile data.\n\nWith its complete feature set, comfortable controls, and premium PS5-inspired look and feel, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition is a no-brainer if you're a PlayStation fan looking for the best remote play experience.",

          "title": "Car recommendations under £7000 (Engineer Andy)",
          "body": "Hi, would like advice on behalf of a relative looking for a replacement for his 2012 Toyota Yaris SR (99bhp). Change in job soon, means will be commuting further than usual and driving around 12-15k miles pa, mostly M and A roads.\n\nCriteria, in no particular order:\n\n1) Better MPG than the current 36mpg\n\n2) Reliability\n\n3) A car with a bit more poke than currently\n\n4) Would prefer the ease of an auto but happy enough with a manual, as reliability and MPG is more important\n\n5) Would prefer something a little sporty looking, but not hugely important\n\n6) Parking sensors/Reverse cam would be a bonus as current vehicle has them\n\n£7000 budget.\n\nThanks\n\nWhilst some have already chimed in with suggestions, one criteria that will make a significant difference is what size of car are you looking for? A direct size replacement - the 'larger' city cars and most superminis, or something larger, or sized from X to Y?\n\nNote that you current 2012 Yaris is slightly smaller (not by much though) than the latest superminis, as cars get a bit larger (for the most part) from one generation to the next, especially now that many have 'SUV' or crossover variants.\n\nBTW - are you looking for a manual, 'proper' auto or 'dual clutch' automated manual (that to many acts like an auto but in reality isn't - epsecially when usage pattern and reliability is taken into account)?\n\nThis will also make a big difference to a second-hand buyer like you, as in my view, dual clutch 'auto' cars may be out, not because they don't suit your driving pattern - they do - but because you cannot guarantee how reliable a second hand car with one will be, because you don't know what usage it got before the purchase.\n\nSuch vehicles aren't suited to predominantly heavy, stop-start traffic driving, and any previous owner could've offloaded it (even someone who's done low mileage) because the clucth pack has likely started to wear.\n\nTraditional 'torque converter' gearboxes are mainly excellent reliability-wise (if maintained properly), but do sap far more power and use more fuel (though a good deal less than they used to 10 years ago) than a dual clutch or CVT box. For example, the current Mazda2 (2015 onwards) has a good amount of the performance credentials you want, but the only (TC) auto version (90hp, none in top spec 115hp version) drops the 0-60 time to below your existing car.\n\nA (well-engineed [not all are]) CVT does combined the best of both the above, but a good number of drivers don't like the noise they make when pushing hard (say on an overtake). Often a matter of personal preference.\n\nAvoid 'automated manual' single clutch gearboxes such as the Honda i-Shift and some others - they aren't nice to use in my view and many appear to suffer from reliability woes, especially as they age.",

          "body": "With a Press Herald subscription, you can gift 5 articles each month.\n\nMaria Jackson, right, moves into a room at a home with the help of friend David Mcfarlan in Las Vegas. Jackson, a longtime massage therapist, lost her customers when the pandemic triggered a statewide shutdown in March 2020 and was evicted from her apartment earlier this year. John Locher/Associated Press\n\nATLANTA -- Entering court using a walker, a doctor's note clutched in his hand, 70-year-old Dana Williams, who suffers serious heart problems, hypertension and asthma, pleaded to delay eviction from his two-bedroom apartment in Atlanta.\n\nAlthough sympathetic, the judge said state law required him to evict Williams and his 25-year-old daughter De'mai Williams in April because they owed $8,348 in unpaid rent and fees on their $940-a-month apartment.\n\nThey have been living in limbo ever since.\n\nThey moved into a dilapidated Atlanta hotel room with water dripping through the bathroom ceiling, broken furniture and no refrigerator or microwave. But at $275-a-week, it was all they could afford on Williams' $900 monthly social security check and the $800 his daughter gets biweekly from a state agency as her father's caretaker.\n\n\"I really don't want to be here by the time his birthday comes\" in August, De'mai Williams said. \"For his health, it's just not right.\"\n\nThe Williams family is among millions of tenants from New York state to Las Vegas who have been evicted or face imminent eviction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a lull during the pandemic, eviction filings by landlords have come roaring back, driven by rising rents and a long-running shortage of affordable housing. Most low-income tenants can no longer count on pandemic resources that had kept them housed, and many are finding it hard to recover because they haven't found steady work or their wages haven't kept pace with the rising cost of rent, food and other necessities.\n\nHomelessness, as a result, is rising.\n\n\"Protections have ended, the federal moratorium is obviously over, and emergency rental assistance money has dried up in most places,\" said Daniel Grubbs-Donovan, a research specialist at Princeton University's Eviction Lab.\n\n\"Across the country, low-income renters are in an even worse situation than before the pandemic due to things like massive increases in rent during the pandemic, inflation and other pandemic-era related financial difficulties.\"\n\nEviction filings are more than 50% higher than the pre-pandemic average in some cities, according to the Eviction Lab, which tracks filings in nearly three dozen cities and 10 states. Landlords file around 3.6 million eviction cases every year.\n\nAmong the hardest-hit are Houston, where rates were 56% higher in April and 50% higher in May. In Minneapolis/St. Paul, rates rose 106% in March, 55% in April and 63% in May. Nashville was 35% higher and Phoenix 33% higher in May; Rhode Island was up 32% in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest data mirrors trends that started last year, with the Eviction Lab finding nearly 970,000 evictions filed in locations it tracks - a 78.6% increase compared to 2021, when much of the country was following an eviction moratorium. By December, eviction filings were nearly back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAt the same time, rent prices nationwide are up about 5% from a year ago and 30.5% above 2019, according to the real estate company Zillow. There are few places for displaced tenants to go, with the National Low Income Housing Coalition estimating a 7.3 million shortfall of affordable units nationwide.\n\nMany vulnerable tenants would have been evicted long ago if not for a safety net created during the pandemic.\n\nThe federal government, as well as many states and localities, issued moratoriums during the pandemic that put evictions on hold; most have now ended. There was also $46.5 billion in federal Emergency Rental Assistance that helped tenants pay rent and funded other tenant protections. Much of that has been spent or allocated, and calls for additional resources have failed to gain traction in Congress.\n\n\"The disturbing rise of evictions to pre-pandemic levels is an alarming reminder of the need for us to act - at every level of government - to keep folks safely housed,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, urging Congress to pass a bill cracking down on illegal evictions, fund legal help for tenants and keep evictions off credit reports.\n\nHousing courts are again filling up and ensnaring the likes of 79-year-old Maria Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson worked for nearly two decades building a loyal clientele as a massage therapist in Las Vegas, which has seen one of the country's biggest jumps in eviction filings. That evaporated during the pandemic-triggered shutdown in March 2020. Her business fell apart; she sold her car and applied for food stamps.\n\nShe got behind on the $1,083 monthly rent on her one-bedroom apartment, and owing $12,489 in back rent was evicted in March. She moved in with a former client about an hour northeast of Las Vegas.\n\n\"Who could imagine this happening to someone who has worked all their life?\" Jackson asked.\n\nLast month she found a room in Las Vegas for $400 a month, paid for with her $1,241 monthly social security check. It's not home, but \"I'm one of the lucky ones,\" she said.\n\n\"I could be in a tent or at a shelter right now.\"\n\nIn upstate New York, evictions are rising after a moratorium lifted last year. Forty of the state's 62 counties had higher eviction filings in 2022 than before the pandemic, including two where eviction filings more than doubled compared to 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"How do we care for the folks who are evicted ... when the capacity is not in place and ready to roll out in places that haven't experienced a lot of eviction recently?\" said Russell Weaver, whose Cornell University lab tracks evictions statewide.\n\nHousing advocates had hoped the Democrat-controlled state Legislature would pass a bill requiring landlords to provide justification for evicting tenants and limit rent increases to 3% or 1.5 times inflation. But it was excluded from the state budget and lawmakers failed to pass it before the legislative session ended this month.\n\n\"Our state Legislature should have fought harder,\" said Oscar Brewer, a tenant organizer facing eviction from the apartment he shares with his 6-year-old daughter in Rochester.\n\nIn Texas, evictions were kept down during the pandemic by federal assistance and the moratoriums. But as protections went away, housing prices skyrocketed in Austin, Dallas and elsewhere, leading to a record 270,000 eviction filings statewide in 2022.\n\nAdvocates were hoping the state Legislature might provide relief, directing some of the $32 billion budget surplus into rental assistance. But that hasn't happened.\n\n\"It's a huge mistake to miss our shot here,\" said Ben Martin, a research director at nonprofit Texas Housers. \"If we don't address it, now, the crisis is going to get worse.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, some pandemic protections are being made permanent, and having an impact on eviction rates. Nationwide, 200 measures have passed since January 2021, including legal representation for tenants, sealing eviction records and mediation to resolve cases before they reach court, said the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nThese measures are credited with keeping eviction filings down in several cities, including New York City and Philadelphia - 41% below pre-pandemic levels in May for the former and 33% for the latter.\n\nA right-to-counsel program and the fact that housing courts aren't prosecuting cases involving rent arears are among the factors keeping New York City filings down.\n\nIn Philadelphia, 70% of the more than 5,000 tenants and landlords who took part in the eviction diversion program resolved their cases. The city also set aside $30 million in assistance for those with less than $3,000 in arears, and started a right-to-counsel program, doubling representation rates for tenants.\n\nThe future is not so bright for Williams and his daughter, who remain stuck in their dimly-lit hotel room. Without even a microwave or nearby grocery stores, they rely on pizza deliveries and snacks from the hotel vending machine.\n\nWilliams used to love having his six grandchildren over for dinner at his old apartment, but those days are over for now.\n\n\"I just want to be able to host my grandchildren,\" he said, pausing to cough heavily. \"I just want to live somewhere where they can come and sit down and hang out with me.\"\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

          "body": "PLAYING PS4 or PS5 games on your living room TV is great, but what if you could turn your phone into a handheld console and take all your games wherever you want?\n\nBackbone's latest mobile controller, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition, promises just that and more, and I tried it for a week to see if it delivers.\n\nWhen you open the box, you'll first see a card with a QR code to download the Backbone app on your phone before you even take the controller out.\n\nThe Backbone app is not required to use the device, but I strongly recommend you install it as it creates a very nice console-like experience and brings some important features.\n\nIt will help you discover new games to play and keep everything in one place, and on Android, the app is free right now, but an upcoming Backbone+ subscription will be adding more features.\n\nAnother reason to have the app installed are features like taking screenshots, capturing gameplay and, more importantly, setting up a quick shortcut to PS Remote Play.\n\nThis particular Backbone One version is an officially licensed product for PlayStation, so expect the build quality and design to match those of your PS5 console.\n\nInstead of a generic ABXY button layout, you have PlayStation's iconic triangle, circle, cross and square face buttons.\n\nThe buttons on the right side and the D-Pad on the left side have the same translucent design seen on the PS5's DualSense controller and you even get a PlayStation logo on the back.\n\nThe L1 and R1 buttons are clicky, and the L2 and R2 are actual analogue triggers with nice travel, while the two analogue sticks are clickable, so you can do L3 and R3.\n\nThe analogue stick layout is asymmetrical, though, which, together with the placement of the Options and Share buttons near the bottom, is a weird choice for an accessory aimed at PlayStation fans.\n\nAnother inconvenience is the lack of a button to press instead of the PlayStation's touchpad, so you'll have to tap twice on your phone's screen to bring up maps and other in-game menus.\n\nThe device feels sturdy and although the side controllers are roughly the size of Nintendo's Joy-con, they are much more comfortable to hold.\n\nThe Android version of the Backbone One PlayStation Edition supports almost any recent phone that runs Android 8.0 or later and has a USB-C connector.\n\nThe device stretches to accommodate a variety of phone sizes, and the protruding camera arrays found on modern phones shouldn't be a problem.\n\nI tested it with the mid-range mid-sized Samsung A53 5G and it fits securely, but it should work well with smaller phones and even larger ones, like Samsung's S23 Ultra.\n\nBecause the Backbone One connects directly to your phone via the USB-C port, there's virtually no input delay caused by the controller itself.\n\nWith the Backbone, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can plug in your favourite wired headset even if your phone doesn't have the audio port, which has become a rarity now.\n\nYou also get a passthrough USB Type-C port, which lets you charge your phone while playing or plug in a power bank for extended gaming sessions on the go.\n\nThe controller itself does not use any external power source or a battery, so it does not require charging - you just snap your phone in, and it always works.\n\nThe Backbone app I mentioned already brings a console-like interface to your phone, letting you launch games and cloud streaming services, watch trailers of upcoming games, and discover new games to play.\n\nThere's a dedicated orange button on the controller to launch the app, and you can set the ellipsis button to open the PS Remote Play with a double tap.\n\nYou can also record video captures and take screenshots of your gameplay as there's a dedicated button for this, too - a short press starts a recording, and a long press takes a screenshot.\n\nThe app also supports its own friends list with chat rooms, and lets you invite other players to a party or voice chat, but you can also use PlayStation's own chat and party features.\n\nBecause it's a PlayStation-themed accessory, you'll most likely use it to play games remotely from your PS4 or PS5, so you will need the free PS Remote Play app installed on your phone.\n\nPlaying PS4 and PS5 games remotely felt great with the controller, and any minor stuttering and input lag issues I experienced were due to internet connection hiccups rather than the Backbone itself.\n\nAs this Backbone One is a licensed PS product, the experience with the PS app was seamless and it automatically detected the controller and prompted me to start a remote play session.\n\nThe controller felt comfortable for extended periods of play and it registered my inputs flawlessly with no perceiveable latency.\n\nUnlike PlayStation's own upcoming handheld, Project Q, the Backbone One allows you to enjoy your PS games both via Wi-Fi and mobile internet, if you have unlimited data plan.\n\nThis means you can play both at home when your main screen is not available, or on the go wherever you are, as long as you have a stable internet connection.\n\nThe minimum recommended internet speed for PS Remote Play is 5Mbps for upload and download, but for the best performance, you need speeds of at least 15Mbps.\n\nDespite being clearly designed with PlayStation fans in mind, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition supports all other remote play and game streaming services and apps.\n\nThis means you can enjoy games installed on your PC via Steam Link, and games from your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One console via Xbox Remote Play.\n\nGames from cloud gaming services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now are also supported, provided you have a subscription for those services.\n\nOf course, you can also play any native mobile game that supports controllers and is installed locally on your phone, such as Diablo Immortal, Call of Duty Mobile, Brawlhalla and many more.\n\nThe controller's asking price of £99.99 is not cheap and rather in line with similar products, but this Backbone version is the only PlayStation-branded mobile controller right now.\n\nAlso, the Backbone One will certainly be the cheaper option to PlayStation's upcoming Project Q, as it doesn't have its own screen, but will let you play over both Wi-Fi and mobile data.\n\nWith its complete feature set, comfortable controls, and premium PS5-inspired look and feel, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition is a no-brainer if you're a PlayStation fan looking for the best remote play experience.",

          "title": "Six defendants in North Staffordshire's courts this week",
          "body": "Here are the latest cases from the region's courts:\n\nHANLEY:\n\nPensioner Raymond Rowley, of Gilman Street, Hanley, admitted causing serious injury by driving without due care and attention. His car was involved in a collision with a motorbike on Leek Road, Shelton, on November 18.\n\nThe 72-year-old's basis of plea was not accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service and a trial of issue will be held at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on June 18 next year. His bail was extended.\n\nSHELTON:\n\nPervert Bobby Whalley, of Leek Road, Stoke, pleaded guilty to attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child between August 16, 2022 and September 7, 2022. The 24-year-old also admitted making indecent images of a child.\n\nHe was placed on the sex offenders' register on an interim basis ahead of his sentence at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on August 10. His bail was extended.\n\nWERRINGTON:\n\nDrink-driver Dean Kyle has been banned from the roads for 30 months after he was caught behind the wheel when more than three-and-a-half times the legal limit. The 41-year-old crashed into a wall on Station Road, Cheddleton, on May 5.\n\nProsecutor Suzanne Swindail told North Staffordshire Justice Centre: \"On arrival, police located the Ford Kuga which had clearly been involved in a road traffic collision. It appeared to have collided with a wall belonging to an address.\n\n\"Police stopped a man they now know to be the defendant. He stated he was the driver at the time. It was clear he was under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\"A roadside breath test gave a positive result. He was arrested. At custody the defendant blew 125 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, against the legal limit of 35.\"\n\nKyle said he attended work at 6am. He was sent home as his boss said he did not look very good. He went to the shop and bought alcohol.\n\nHe accepted he was involved in the crash. He added he was struggling with depression and was in a routine of putting his daughter to bed and drinking in excess of a bottle of wine. He is seeking help and plans to stop drinking.\n\nKyle, of Capesthorne Close, Werrington, pleaded guilty to drink-driving.\n\nMark Bromley, mitigating, said Kyle works for a Leek engineering firm and is highly regarded. He now cycles to work every day. Mr Bromley said: \"He was suffering from depression. He has not had a drink since the incident. He has now realised drink is not the answer to his problems.\"\n\nMagistrates sentenced Kyle to a two year community order with a rehabilitation activity requirement for 20 days and 220 hours unpaid work.\n\nHe was ordered to pay £135 costs and £114 surcharge. His ban will be reduced by 30 weeks if he completes a drink-driver rehabilitation course.\n\nBENTILEE:\n\nDad Benjamin Green smashed up his ex's new partner's car. North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard the 31-year-old smashed every window of the victim's Ford Fiesta with a brick at 9pm on May 7.\n\nHe ran off before officers arrived. Police went to his mum's address and arrested him there. He was taken to hospital as he needed treatment for an injury to his hand.\n\nThe victim had to pay £400 excess.\n\nGreen, of Dividy Road, Bentilee, pleaded guilty to criminal damage. In his police interview he said his daughter had told him his ex's new partner had been nasty to her.\n\nMike Kimberley, mitigating, said Green was devastated when his partner told him she had someone else.\n\nHis daughter became upset when staying with Green and did not want to return home. Mr Kimberley said: \"She said the injured party had been nasty. He accepts he had a couple of pints.\n\n\"He went to challenge the injured party. He knocked on the door and there was no answer. He looked through the living room window and was taunted by the injured party making gestures towards him.\n\n\"He walked down the driveway. There was a comment made. He saw a house brick, picked it up in temper and caused the damage. He injured himself and went to hospital.\"\n\nMagistrates fined Green £461 and ordered him to pay £135 costs, a £184 surcharge and £400 compensation.\n\nLONGTON:\n\nBanned driver Carl Hales has been handed eight penalty points on his licence after he was caught behind the wheel. The 34-year-old was seen driving a silver Renault Clio in Church Road, Blurton, on January 19 and police discovered a woman was insured to drive the vehicle.\n\nIt was stopped in Ulverston Road, Newstead, and the officer established Hales had no insurance to drive the car. He said it belonged to his partner.\n\nProsecutor Suzanne Swindail told North Staffordshire Justice Centre: \"A further check showed he was disqualified through the totting up procedure. He was disqualified on October 6 until April 5.\"\n\nHales, of Clayfield Grove, Longton, pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.\n\nMark Bromley, mitigating, said Hales was aware he was not insured but when officers spoke to him he was not aware he was a disqualified driver.\n\nMr Bromley said: \"He says he was stopped during covid but heard nothing at all. He had been disqualified for six months under the totting up procedure.\n\n\"He has not driven since January despite the fact his ban expired on April 5.\"\n\nMagistrates fined Hales £240 and ordered him to pay £135 costs and a £96 surcharge.\n\nFENTON:\n\nBusinessman Sajid Iqbal has been banned from driving for 40 months after he overtook a car on the wrong side of the road and failed to provide a specimen of breath for analysis.\n\nProsecutor Suzanne Swindail told North Staffordshire Justice Centre officers were on Best Street, Fenton, at 11.30pm on February 22. Miss Swindail said: \"They saw a small Vauxhall Corsa on King Street followed by a Jaguar F Pace.\n\n\"It overtook the Corsa going the wrong side of the keep left bollards. It was wholly inappropriate. Officers approached and were hit by the smell of liquor. His eyes were glazed. As he stepped out of the car he was unsteady on his feet.\"\n\nHe admitted going the wrong side of the keep left bollards and said he just wanted to pass the car as he was going slow. He gave a positive roadside breath test and was taken to custody where he refused to provide two samples of breath for analysis.\n\nIqbal, of Woodcote Drive, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to failing to provide a specimen of breath for analysis and driving without due care and attention.\n\nDavid Ellis, mitigating, said Iqbal had been at a business meeting and accepts he drank some alcohol. He said: \"He was not abusive or aggressive, he just did not provide a sample.\"\n\nHe said Iqbal provided a reading of 44 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath at the roadside, against the legal limit of 35.\n\nMagistrates sentenced Iqbal to a community order with a rehabilitation activity requirement for 30 days and 200 hours unpaid work. He was fined £204 and ordered to pay £135 costs and a £114 surcharge.\n\nCOURT AND CRIME NEWSLETTER: Sign up for email alerts direct to your inbox\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nMotorists beware: 10 weeks of roadworks at busy JCB roundabout\n\nStoke double murder suspect Veronique John remanded in custody",

It was hardly a bold prediction -- Samsung has ruled the high-end Android world for a few years now, just as the latest iPhone always wows iOS fans and critics. Another similarity with Apple devices is the premium price tag that the Samsung handsets command, with the base model of the Galaxy S23 retailing for $799 in the US.

          "body": "Read Latest News on Sports, Business, Entertainment, Blogs and Opinions from leading columnists.\n\nNikos Papadogiannis analyzes the data in the Vyzenkov case and believes the farewell tears may have been premature.\n\na Olympic These days he lives in a heap between his ears Alexandru Vizhenkov. If the striker with three passports and countless talents decides to stay in Piraeus, he will stay in Piraeus: Kings They may have the right to buy his contract, but they will not take him prisoner in the contract Sacramento. If, once again, he himself wants to redeem his two years of miracles by jumping to the other planet, no force is able to keep his place empty on the flight across the Atlantic. The NBA holds the entire squad in its hands, with the exception of the aces. This is on the cover of the player.\n\n\"the Vyzenkov He has to leave to take the next step in his career,\" someone told me the other day Sasha's chosen citizen, or George Pomasky. I swear by passing that thumbs up Pomasky He is his close friend Georgy Glotskov, the first Eastern European to open the gates to the NBA. his secrets Miltos Tedoglu They got to Sofia (and from there to Athens) through Glutskov, through it Vlad Divac, With his amazing high jump Dragutin theme. Thus they will also penetrate his mind Christian Golomeev The Bulgarian-Greek swimmer who will work with Pomaski in his attempt to overcome the illusion of a swimmer's slow start and become an Olympian. The circle closes, and the arc closes as well.\n\nSince I like to be a heretic even when there is no particular reason, you will permit me to write that Vyzenkov Still in flight. To move to the next jump, he must first complete the previous jump. To win the Euroleague MVP award is undoubtedly a personal achievement, while his improvement over the last 2-3 years can be seen from space, not to mention Sacramento. but:\n\n* his game Vyzenkov It remains somewhat incongruous and runs through the coach's mass and the team's greatness. His long shot must be executed in good conditions to get close to 50%, and his off-the-ball game requires complete choreography to exploit. In the NBA, where one-on-one reigns supreme, he has no such illusions. Fezhenkov's body is strong, but not strong enough to compete with the hot \"four\" in which he will meet America, \"Three's\" in the NBA are now ball handlers while Sasha isn't, bouncing back would be a more difficult task. If he were to go to the NBA and become a shooter as Americans once envisioned him...Spanolis, or back up for seven hours in half, I don't think it makes sense. For everyone who loves cuts, I remind you that in Houston OR Costas Papanicolaou He was playing at \"4\". Basketball has changed since then, but there are no signs that Vyzenkov is destined to star in the elite Kings From the year 2023. Nor that he can immediately take on heavy and unhealthy duties.\n\n* Vezenkov's mission to Piraeus, if there is such a thing, is still far from \"mission accomplished\". If Olympiacos returned from Kaunas (or who Belgrade) Hero, I'll be sure to escape the groom. I remember writing it back in the last four days: When you get to the top, the only way your eyes see is down. Without Vezenkov and maybe it is behaviorWith almost all of its players now reaching the age of 30, Olympiacos will have to rebuild. His out-of-bounds roars will inevitably become more rare, since (with the obvious exception of the Gallic MiroticThere is no player in Europe who is able to step straight into Vyzenkov's boot and find it so comfortable. The \"red and white\" movements show that the plan is to follow the (successful) course for the next two years, without serious modifications to the racing model. I'm trying to say that Fezhenkov must be thinking about the spring drizzle today Berlin And no California sunshine. Olympiacos may have won the double within the walls, but the groovy quilt of the Greek championship is not enough to cover an aspiring athlete's shoe. Only fanatics and hooligans deal with the \"eternal derby\" anymore. Players assure you that they treat them as a chore and a necessary evil.\n\nI haven't checked his bank account lately Sasha Vyzenkov And I'm not in a position to know if hitting zeros is in his interest. Nor do I intend to try to analyze the rules of the labyrinth in the NBA with its windows and skylights salary capat various levels Exceptions And the accompanying rumors of the still closed market.\n\nthe Kings They are not allowed to call numbers starting from 0030 - before next Friday nor make offers for free players before the 30th of the month. Depending on the rest of the plan they have in mind, and it should not be thought that they are nothing but infallible tactical masterminds, they may craft an attractive package with which it is impossible to rival Olympiacos, or even bring down Vyzenkov. Low, low, and from his current contract cap (when the IRS is also taken into account).\n\nThey'll want to break piggy banks and shake up the hit team that got them the Warriors In 7 matches for a bet from Europe? I personally have my doubts, considering Sasha's mediocre performance in several playoff games this year (when he went down to Greece...all Sacramento to see) and I always remember that Vyzenkov He is no longer 23 years old, a spring chicken, but he is (he turns 28 in August).\n\nIn theory, this is his last chance to leave Greece's bad weather behind and start a new life in his territorial waters Divas so is it Pizza, but this adage also holds water. The dominant contract that Olympiacos is poised to get a \"yes\" (in any of the many languages spoken by Sasha) in the coming days will also have NBA exit clauses. the 2024 It's not far.",

          "body": "PLAYING PS4 or PS5 games on your living room TV is great, but what if you could turn your phone into a handheld console and take all your games wherever you want?\n\nBackbone's latest mobile controller, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition, promises just that and more, and I tried it for a week to see if it delivers.\n\nWhen you open the box, you'll first see a card with a QR code to download the Backbone app on your phone before you even take the controller out.\n\nThe Backbone app is not required to use the device, but I strongly recommend you install it as it creates a very nice console-like experience and brings some important features.\n\nIt will help you discover new games to play and keep everything in one place, and on Android, the app is free right now, but an upcoming Backbone+ subscription will be adding more features.\n\nAnother reason to have the app installed are features like taking screenshots, capturing gameplay and, more importantly, setting up a quick shortcut to PS Remote Play.\n\nThis particular Backbone One version is an officially licensed product for PlayStation, so expect the build quality and design to match those of your PS5 console.\n\nInstead of a generic ABXY button layout, you have PlayStation's iconic triangle, circle, cross and square face buttons.\n\nThe buttons on the right side and the D-Pad on the left side have the same translucent design seen on the PS5's DualSense controller and you even get a PlayStation logo on the back.\n\nThe L1 and R1 buttons are clicky, and the L2 and R2 are actual analogue triggers with nice travel, while the two analogue sticks are clickable, so you can do L3 and R3.\n\nThe analogue stick layout is asymmetrical, though, which, together with the placement of the Options and Share buttons near the bottom, is a weird choice for an accessory aimed at PlayStation fans.\n\nAnother inconvenience is the lack of a button to press instead of the PlayStation's touchpad, so you'll have to tap twice on your phone's screen to bring up maps and other in-game menus.\n\nThe device feels sturdy and although the side controllers are roughly the size of Nintendo's Joy-con, they are much more comfortable to hold.\n\nThe Android version of the Backbone One PlayStation Edition supports almost any recent phone that runs Android 8.0 or later and has a USB-C connector.\n\nThe device stretches to accommodate a variety of phone sizes, and the protruding camera arrays found on modern phones shouldn't be a problem.\n\nI tested it with the mid-range mid-sized Samsung A53 5G and it fits securely, but it should work well with smaller phones and even larger ones, like Samsung's S23 Ultra.\n\nBecause the Backbone One connects directly to your phone via the USB-C port, there's virtually no input delay caused by the controller itself.\n\nWith the Backbone, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can plug in your favourite wired headset even if your phone doesn't have the audio port, which has become a rarity now.\n\nYou also get a passthrough USB Type-C port, which lets you charge your phone while playing or plug in a power bank for extended gaming sessions on the go.\n\nThe controller itself does not use any external power source or a battery, so it does not require charging - you just snap your phone in, and it always works.\n\nThe Backbone app I mentioned already brings a console-like interface to your phone, letting you launch games and cloud streaming services, watch trailers of upcoming games, and discover new games to play.\n\nThere's a dedicated orange button on the controller to launch the app, and you can set the ellipsis button to open the PS Remote Play with a double tap.\n\nYou can also record video captures and take screenshots of your gameplay as there's a dedicated button for this, too - a short press starts a recording, and a long press takes a screenshot.\n\nThe app also supports its own friends list with chat rooms, and lets you invite other players to a party or voice chat, but you can also use PlayStation's own chat and party features.\n\nBecause it's a PlayStation-themed accessory, you'll most likely use it to play games remotely from your PS4 or PS5, so you will need the free PS Remote Play app installed on your phone.\n\nPlaying PS4 and PS5 games remotely felt great with the controller, and any minor stuttering and input lag issues I experienced were due to internet connection hiccups rather than the Backbone itself.\n\nAs this Backbone One is a licensed PS product, the experience with the PS app was seamless and it automatically detected the controller and prompted me to start a remote play session.\n\nThe controller felt comfortable for extended periods of play and it registered my inputs flawlessly with no perceiveable latency.\n\nUnlike PlayStation's own upcoming handheld, Project Q, the Backbone One allows you to enjoy your PS games both via Wi-Fi and mobile internet, if you have unlimited data plan.\n\nThis means you can play both at home when your main screen is not available, or on the go wherever you are, as long as you have a stable internet connection.\n\nThe minimum recommended internet speed for PS Remote Play is 5Mbps for upload and download, but for the best performance, you need speeds of at least 15Mbps.\n\nDespite being clearly designed with PlayStation fans in mind, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition supports all other remote play and game streaming services and apps.\n\nThis means you can enjoy games installed on your PC via Steam Link, and games from your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One console via Xbox Remote Play.\n\nGames from cloud gaming services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now are also supported, provided you have a subscription for those services.\n\nOf course, you can also play any native mobile game that supports controllers and is installed locally on your phone, such as Diablo Immortal, Call of Duty Mobile, Brawlhalla and many more.\n\nThe controller's asking price of £99.99 is not cheap and rather in line with similar products, but this Backbone version is the only PlayStation-branded mobile controller right now.\n\nAlso, the Backbone One will certainly be the cheaper option to PlayStation's upcoming Project Q, as it doesn't have its own screen, but will let you play over both Wi-Fi and mobile data.\n\nWith its complete feature set, comfortable controls, and premium PS5-inspired look and feel, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition is a no-brainer if you're a PlayStation fan looking for the best remote play experience.",

The interface recently received a significant overhaul with the introduction of OxygenOS 12. Now the OS is officially based on the ColorOS, which the company says helps bring more stability to the OS and users can expect to see the new features at a faster rate. As OxygenOS 12 continues to roll out to more and more devices, users are now eager to know what new features and improvements the next iteration of the interface, the OxygenOS 13, will bring to the table. In this article, we go through everything there is to know about the Android 13-based OxygenOS 13 update including its expected new features and improvements.\n\nOnePlus hasn't revealed the official rollout schedule for the OxygenOS 13 update as of now. But if history is any indication, we can expect to see the new interface hit the OnePlus devices later this year. We speculate the first stable build of the OxygenOS 13 to be available as soon as Q3 of 2022. OnePlus recently invited its India OnePlus Community members to join the CBT Program to test the early builds of the OxygenOS 13 for the OnePlus 10 Pro and give feedback. If you are curious you can join the CBT Program by following the below steps:\n\nAns) To apply for the OxygenOS CBT (Closed Beta Test) Program, you need to own an Indian variant of the OnePlus 10 Pro and be an active member of the OnePlus Community and be willing to communicate with the OnePlus team to share bugs you encounter while testing and any suggestions you have. If you meet these requirements, go ahead and click the Apply Now button at the bottom of this OnePlus blog post. Keep in mind that OnePlus is only accepting up to 200 beta testers to test the early builds of OxygenOS 13.\n\nApart from this, a Developer Build is also available to flash that doesn't require an invitation. A word of advice here is that all these builds are experimental and may break at any time. So don't install these on your daily driver.\n\nWe'll keep updating the article whenever OnePlus releases further updates and CBT tests for new devices.\n\nAns) OnePlus's decision to merge its OxygenOS with Oppo's ColorOS met with a bit of criticism from long-term OnePlus fans. After a bit of back and forth, the company backtracked its plans to bring a unified OS by merging both the OSes and announced that it'll continue to update existing OxygenOS on the OnePlus devices. The company, however, maintained that it'll continue to base the new OxygenOS builds on top of the ColorOS. It said that doing so will help it bring a bug-free OS and release new features at a faster rate to its users.\n\nHowever, the company a while back held an Open Ear Forum, where it admitted its faults and said \"OxygenOS 12 did not launch to a standard that meets our own expectations or those of our Community.\"\n\nNow that the Android 13 is nearly ready to roll out to the masses, which the OxygenOS 13 is expected to be based on, OnePlus is once again committing to building its in-house skin in a way that will please the enthusiasts. After receiving the required feedback from its Open Ear Forum, OnePlus said that they'll work on these areas for the\n\nOxygenOS 13 update:\n\n* Improve UI personalisation and consistency\n\n* Improve system consistency and more optimised functions path\n\n* Add more features in AOD (like Music Player)\n\n* Optimised Zen Mode to provide users with a more immersive and efficient experience\n\n* Positive communication with community members (like optimising CBT projects, more OEF, and so on）\n\nThe company further notes that it'll stick to its \"core product philosophy\" to bring a \"fast and smooth, burdenless experience\" that the OnePlus aims to achieve with its OxygenOS.\n\nFurther in the OnePlus 10T launch event, OnePlus announced some of the upcoming features of the OxygenOS 13. Let's take a look:\n\nAquamorphic design\n\nOnePlus is introducing a new design language called \"Aquamorphic design\" with OxygenOS 13. The company says that it is taking inspiration from nature to create a \"burdenless design\" and has come up with the \"Aquamorphic design\", which is inspired by the amorphous properties of water, is \"effortlessly smooth\", and features \"fluid adaptation, seamless integration, natural vitality\". The new UX includes a completely redesigned colour scheme, icon design, interface, and layouts, says OnePlus. OnePlus further notes that it has made at least 595 meticulous design changes in OxygenOS 13 to ensure UX consistency across the OS.\n\nImproved resource allocation and memory management\n\nOnePlus is making changes to the way OxygenOS manages resources and memory. OnePlus has optimised the OxygenOS 13's AI System Booster to achieve up to 30 percent fluency rate, up to 20 percent faster app installation speed, and up to 10 percent faster app startup speed. OnePlus says that the OxygenOS 13 elevates the overall experience of OS and now offers a \"smooth, stable, and seamless experience.\"\n\nImprovements to OxygenOS AOD features\n\nThe company has always used AMOLED panels on most of the portfolio of its Android devices and has offered an Always-on Display (AOD) feature to quickly glance at important information while the phone is locked. The company is now heavily iterating on the AOD feature. OnePlus has extended its partnership with Spotify and is offering extensive controls for Spotify on the AOD screen. You now get music recommendations along with the music controls such as play/pause, forward/backwards, and favourites shortcuts. Further, the company is extending AOD features to Food Delivery AOD, Insight AOD, and Bitmoji AOD.\n\nGaming improvements\n\nOnePlus is giving a big boost to gaming as well. The company has integrated an improved HyperBoost Gaming Engine and GPA 4.0 frame stabiliser for a smooth and effortless gaming experience. It also includes performance modes to tune the battery savings or prioritise high frame rates for pro gamers.\n\nQuality of life improvements to System launcher\n\nOnePlus has improved the system launcher and has introduced what the company calls 'Smart Launcher'. The system launcher is now efficient and intuitive at handling things and the large and small folders now dynamically adjust for a more organised space on the home screen. The company says the smart features also extend to other aspects of the launcher including widgets, app handling, and update notifications.\n\nSidebar Toolbox improvements\n\nUsers can now add their favourite apps to the Sidebar Toolbox, which is a folder of apps that users can access by swiping on assigned areas on the edges of the display. To recall, a similar feature is also present on Oppo's ColorOS.\n\nDolby Atmos, Spatial Audio, and fast pair\n\nOnePlus is introducing support for Dolby Atmos (requires hardware support) and support for Spatial Audio to improve the music listening experience. There is now support for Fast pair, which is a feature introduced by Google to make it easy to connect wireless earphones. OnePlus is also adding support for Audio Switch to the OxygenOS 13 to make it easy to switch between multiple connected devices easily.\n\nSupport for Nearby Share, RCS messaging, Safety Centre\n\nOnePlus is borrowing many Android 13 features for the OxygenOS 13 update. Since the new interface is based on Android 13, the new interface now includes support for Nearby Sharen, RCS messaging as well as a Safety Centre feature, which lets you easily see and control the privacy permissions of apps.\n\nEnhanced Private Safe\n\nOnePlus has enhanced the Private Safe feature of OxygenOS and is now using AES encryption to protect sensitive files such as documents, images, videos, and other files. This ensures private files cannot be accessed by third-party apps as well by unauthorised users.\n\nAlso Read: OnePlus 11 5G Jupiter Rock edition tipped to launch in India after China Release",

          "title": "Is Digi International Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DGII) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way?",
          "body": "Digi International (NASDAQ:DGII) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 20% over the last three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Digi International's ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors' money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Digi International\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Digi International is:\n\n5.2% = US$27m ÷ US$520m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit.\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nAt first glance, Digi International's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 11%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Digi International grew its net income at a significant rate of 31% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nNext, on comparing Digi International's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 34% over the last few years.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It's important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is DGII worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether DGII is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nDigi International doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nIn total, it does look like Digi International has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

          "body": "The Indian Railways will review every aspect of safety in the operation of trains to ensure foolproof working of the system.\n\nExpressing grave concern over the tragic train accident at Bahanaga Bazar railway station in Odisha which left 288 passengers dead and over 900 injured, Chairman Railway Board/Chief Executive Officer (CRB/CEO) A. K. Lahoti directed top railway officers, including General Managers of all Zonal Railways, to review safety in the entire system for foolproof working against external and internal issues.\n\n\"The recent serious accident at Bahanaga Bazar in South Eastern Railway with high loss of life and injury is a matter of grave concern... While the cause of this accident is under investigation, it needs to be re-emphasized that safety has a large number of dimensions and each and every aspect is required to be reviewed and ensured for zero compromise,\" he said while addressing the top railway officials at a safety review meeting convened this week.\n\nAlso Read | Odisha train accident: IRCTC walks the extra mile to facilitate insurance settlements\n\nMr. Lahoti said every railway employee was responsible for safety irrespective of the department. While maintenance of infrastructure was very important, it should to be ensured that maintenance works are carried out only under block/disconnection (temporary stoppage of trains to facilitate repair/maintenance works).\n\nNo shortcuts\n\n\"Employees must not resort to shortcuts at all. It is necessary for senior officers to bring about a change in the mindset of field employees that getting block/ disconnection is not an issue. Field employees must not feel constrained in asking for blocks for maintenance of infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nFor this purpose, Divisional Railway Managers should interact with field staff personally, and assure them that block or disconnection would be given as a matter of safe working culture. \"Before clearing the block/disconnection it must be ensured that the attended asset has been restored properly - where required, testing should be carried out. The asset should be functioning correctly.\"\n\nHe said that the punctual running of trains and maintenance were both equally important. It was the role of the General Manager and the DRM to maintain a balance between the two objectives.\n\nStop train when in doubt\n\nMr. Lahoti said even lowest level employees in the Railways should not feel hesitant to stop a train if they found that there were unsafe conditions for its movement. Some error of judgment in this regard should be allowed.\n\nInstructing officers to assess the working of the staff and train them on the spot, the CRB said the purpose of inspections should not be to find faults. Employees should be counselled against \"chalta hai\" attitude.\n\nSenior railway officers were told to make best use of the Integrated Coach Management System, which records unusual incidents on a daily basis, to identify the trends and major problems so that corrective measures could be initiated. Emphasis on statistical reduction of failures should be avoided. Railway investigators should go into full details of \"near-miss\" cases, he said adding that reporting of all failures should be encouraged.",

          "body": "Gregg Wallace has spoken out after leaving a popular BBC show, following allegations of rudeness towards staff. After hosting Inside The Factory for seven seasons, Wallace has said he stepped down to care for his four-year-old autistic son.\n\nHowever, reports claim that he left due to being \"rude\" to his programme colleagues, particularly women and making comments about their weight.\n\nWallace has since spoken out, saying that he didn't realise that what he considered to be jokes could also be upsetting, and that he never set out to hurt anyone, reports Birmingham Live. He also highlighted that times have changed and certain things are more controversial.\n\nSpeaking on the allegations, a source told The Times: \"He was rude towards staff and continued to talk in a derogatory manner, especially to women.\"\n\nSince then, the MasterChef presenter has addressed the claims. He told the same publication: \"I've enjoyed doing [Inside The Factory] for a number of years and I've done hundreds of factories.\n\n\"I use humour to relax people. It's a tool I've used for lots of years. I never, ever set out to upset or offend anybody and I never would. It makes me upset that I might have upset people.\"\n\nThe much-loved presenter also touched on his success but accepted that times had changed and certain things could be controversial. He added: \"Things change, they evolve. So they should. We should be more careful.\n\n\"All I would say is perhaps we need to draw a line between people that are bullies or nasty people and people that have made a mistake. Perhaps.\"\n\nGregg confirmed once more that his main priority is his four-year-old son who he shares with his wife Anne-Marie Sterpini, 37.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

It's believed a two-vehicle collision around the junction of Furlong Road and Newport Lane in Middleport left the car in the wall - and partly in the rear garden.\n\nPhotographs from the scene show police coned the area off as the stricken cab was recovered. Now Megan, who lives on Supreme Street, has told StokeonTrentLive how she was woken up to the sound of the crash.\n\nThe 24-year-old said: \"It all took place at about 6.30am this morning. We were in bed and heard a crash and then sirens.\n\n\"I came outside to see what was going on. My daughter's swing is the other side of the wall and was knocked down and I dread to think if this had happened later in the day while we were out in the garden.\"\n\nREAD: 20 caravans pitch up on popular Stoke-on-Trent park\n\nMegan, who is seven months pregnant, says it's not the first time there has been a crash right on her doorstep. Back in the New Year of 2021 a car collided with the wall at the front of the family home.\n\nNow Megan, who has lived in the property since 2019, says herself and other residents want to see road improvements in the area. She said: \"There used to be railings at the junction of Newport Lane but they were taken down and not replaced.\n\n\"The road markings are all really badly worn away and this is a busy road. I now have to think about letting my daughter play out.\"\n\nHer damaged wall is set to be fixed on Monday. Megan added: \"The housing association has been really good and said someone will be out to fix it.\"\n\nStaffordshire Police have not yet released any details on the collision.\n\nSign up to our main daily newsletter here and get all the latest news straight to your inbox for FREE\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nTemporary lights go up as work continues on new Stoke-on-Trent estate\n\nWe tackled The Polite Vicar's £19.99 'biggest ever burger' - after a pretty big wait",

          "body": "A Teesside college programme has been graded 'good' after a previous inspection found improvements were needed.\n\nMiddlesbrough College's Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programme for students aiming to become the next generation of educators was inspected twice between 2021 and 2022 by standards body Ofsted, however both inspections found it 'required improvement'. Now, after a third inspection in May, the team are celebrating a 'good' rating.\n\nPrevious inspections found that progress for trainees in the programme were 'slower than expected' and highlighted that feedback from tutors had 'not been developed enough'. However, following a visit from inspectors between May 2 and May 5, it was reported that 'significant improvements have been made'.\n\nREAD MORE: King's Birthday Honours 2023: The incredible Teessiders among thousands nationwide that made list\n\nThe college programme at the time of inspection had 36 trainees on the further education and skills phase of their training. There were also 10 trainees on the level five certificate in education and 25 trainees on a level six professional graduate certificate in education.\n\nIn its latest report, Ofsted noted that trainee teachers at Middlesbrough College \"gain substantial new knowledge and skills to prepare them to be 21st-century educators\".\n\nDespite previous reports noting issues with feedback from tutors, the new report stated: \"[Students] learn from expert tutors and mentors who help them secure their understanding of contemporary teaching strategies.\n\n\"Trainees are nurtured to try new approaches and develop their individual craft to be effective teachers.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted the positive work of the leaders and managers on the ITE programme, saying they had 'developed an ambitious curriculum' which is relevant to educational research. It also noted that the trainees can confidently explain these concepts and put them to practice with their teaching.\n\nInspectors looked at previous issues where trainees had not passed the first module at the first attempt and how tutors and management responded to this. They said that the team was 'quick to respond' and create additional resources to ensure trainees were supported and passed.\n\nThe report reads: \"Leaders, managers and tutors responded quickly to this issue by creating additional resources to support trainees in structuring their assignments and enhancing their academic writing skills.\n\n\"They also improved access for trainees to existing academic support. Trainees used this additional support to improve, and all achieved in subsequent assessments. \"\n\nChiefs at Middlesbrough College have been thrilled with the outcome of the assessment, and said that the latest report is 'a tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff'.\n\nBen Robinson, deputy principal and head of curriculum at Middlesbrough College, said: \"We are absolutely delighted to see that the work which everyone has been putting in has been recognised in this latest Ofsted report.\n\n\"It is a tribute to the dedication and determination of our teaching and support staff that the quality of our training has been recognised and acknowledged by the inspectors.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing our progress and to giving the educators of tomorrow the best possible start to their careers in the classroom.\"\n\nInspectors also praised how well the college's ITE courses prepared student teachers for life in the classroom. Their report said: \"Trainees gain experience in the wider role of a teacher, including curriculum design, quality assurance and pastoral responsibilities.\n\n\"Through opportunities to observe colleagues teaching different levels, qualification types and subjects, most trainees gain an understanding of the wider sector in further education.\n\n\"Trainees understand the realities of teaching, and most feel well prepared to move on to the next steps of their career, including being aware of options for professional formation.\"\n\nOfsted also singled out how the College has \"designed an ITE programme which is well suited for trainees who come directly from industry with no prior experience in teaching\". One of the students on the college's ITE programme, Benn Whitehead, is currently studying for his Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) after first arriving at the college as a school leaver in 2014.\n\nAs part of his teacher training, Benn has been teaching students on the college's Level 3 Performing Arts (Acting) course which he originally studied almost ten years ago. Benn said: \"I knew going into teaching that I wanted to teach at college level and I couldn't think of anywhere better than to return to Middlesbrough College to complete my training. The teaching on my PGCE course has been second to none.\n\n\"I'm now looking to step into my first professional teaching role, and I hope to inspire other young people who have an interest in performing arts in the North-East.\"\n\nMiddlesbrough College principal and chief executive Zoe Lewis said: \"There can be fewer things more important in education than ensuring that those who will go on to teach the students of tomorrow get the best possible grounding.\n\n\"That's why I'm so pleased that the team on the ITE programme have had their hard work recognised in this latest Ofsted report.\n\n\"As with all 12,000 students at Middlesbrough College, we want to equip our trainee teachers with the skills and the confidence to pursue their life and career goals.\n\n\"It is great that we now have independent confirmation that we are doing exactly that.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n'Breathtaking' pub and memorial bar crowned as region's favourite pub by Teesside Live readers Suspected bill dodgers leave £108 unpaid tab at 'best curry house in the North East'",

          "body": "She was buried on her side, as if sleeping, a few yards away. One of her teeth had been intentionally altered, most likely in Africa, experts said, before she was forced into enslavement in Maryland.\n\nThey were exhumed this spring to save them from the elements, and archaeologists have now declared that they are among the oldest African American burials ever found in the state.\n\n\"Together they represent two of the earliest ... if not the earliest individuals of African descent ever studied in Maryland,\" said Travis Parno, acting executive director of Historic St. Mary's City, the organization that conducted the dig about 70 miles southeast of Washington.\n\nThe burials may have happened as early as the 1680s, he said in a recent telephone interview. \"And at the latest, probably 1730s.\"\n\nThe dig was conducted to save the remains, which had already been damaged by uprooted trees and erosion at the river, he said.\n\nThe woman's burial was first identified in the 1970s. The man's was identified in 1980. Both were left mostly in place because they weren't then under threat, Parno said.\n\nThe project was undertaken with the support of the local African American community.\n\n\"If we didn't disinter them,\" much could have been lost, said Kelsey R.M. Bush, a member of the Chancellor's Point Working Group, the community advisory team: \"Not understanding the story ... [not] understanding how hallowed the ground actually is.\"\n\n\"Now we can put them at rest,\" he said in a recent telephone interview. \"And celebrate their spirit and perseverance and ... that root from which we all came.\"\n\nBush, who is also Community Affairs Liaison at St. Mary's College of Maryland, said too often the dark story of slavery has been ignored in the teaching of the country's history.\n\n\"Growing up down here and visiting [historic sites] it was one of those things that you never envisioned yourself as being part of the picture,\" said Bush.\n\n\"We need to tell truth,\" he said. \"We need to fund things like anthropology and archaeology ... Without them we don't really understand ourselves.\"\n\nBush said his family roots go back many generations in St. Mary's, and his great grandfather on his father's side was born into slavery in Alabama.\n\n\"I wonder what my ancestors would think of me being employed here and getting paid to work here on land that they toiled on and spilled blood on,\" he said. \"This is a very special place for me in a different sort of way.\"\n\nThe bones discovered along the river on land owned by the state of Maryland are now in the Historic St. Mary's City laboratory.\n\nThe plan is to have them undergo examination at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, in Washington, and then be properly reburied. Those arrangements have not yet been made.\n\nDouglas Owsley, the museum's curator of biological anthropology, said the structure of the man's face and skull, and the woman's altered tooth, indicate that the two people were of African descent.\n\nHe said the alteration was in an upper front tooth and that other teeth, which are missing, were probably also modified.\n\nScholars have identified dental alteration as a cultural practice in Africa that shows up in some burials of the enslaved.\n\n\"I think this is a game-changing discovery for Historic St. Mary's City [and] for Maryland,\" Parno said. \"These are two individuals who went unrecorded in the historical record\" but who now add to the story of the period.\n\nThe first permanent White settlers came to what is now St. Mary's City, in southern Maryland, in 1634. Enslaved Africans arrived soon after.\n\n\"From the early 1630s, we know there were enslaved people here,\" Parno said. \"Enslavement began from the outset\" and spread dramatically over next few decades.\n\nThe exhumation comes a few weeks after Parno's team and anthropologists from the Smithsonian unearthed the remains of a teenage boy with a broken leg who is believed to be among Maryland's first White colonists.\n\nAnd in 2021, Historic St. Mary's City announced that its experts had found the outlines of the long-lost fort that was erected by the first colonists. The two enslaved persons were buried about a mile and a half from that site.\n\n\"It speaks to the incredible archaeological legacy of St. Mary's City,\" Parno said in an email. \"There is just so much history here and in addition to being Maryland stories, these are national stories ... [and] key to that national narrative.\"\n\nThe original 150 colonists, including many English Catholics fleeing Protestant persecution, arrived at St. Mary's on two ships, the Ark and the Dove, in late March 1634.\n\nThe settlement, which was the colony's first capital, was abandoned after the government moved to Annapolis in the 1690s.\n\nBut before the move, the Maryland legislature in 1664 enacted a comprehensive slave code -- the first in English-speaking North America, Parno said.\n\nIt decreed that \"people of African descent are going to be enslaved for life, and their children for their lives as well,\" he said.\n\nFuneral rites \"were one of the few [activities] enslaved Africans were allowed to conduct on their own, without any interference from the enslavers,\" Henry M. Miller, Maryland heritage scholar with Historic St. Mary's City, said in an email.\n\nThe exhumed man is thought to have been in his early 30s when he died, but he had the deteriorated spine of a man in his 50s, Parno said.\n\n\"That's someone who did a lot of hard work in their life, a lot of backbreaking work,\" he said.\n\nThe man also had a \"pipe facet\" in a tooth, a groove worn by a clay pipe he smoked -- perhaps one of his few pleasures.\n\nThe man was buried with care, his hands folded, his body facing the water -- \"almost looking out at the mouth of the river,\" Parno said, maybe \"toward the avenue home.\"\n\nBush, of the community group, said: \"He's facing down river towards Africa,\" as if those who buried him were saying, \"we're sending you back.\"\n\nBut several centuries later, the river had come too close and erosion had already carried away the man's lower legs.\n\n\"This was a case of preservation,\" Parno said. \"We felt we had to do this project, and we only moved forward with it with the blessing of members of our community who said, 'No, we need to save these burials.'\"\n\nThe woman was buried on her side. She was 24 to 27 years old and had a modest build.\n\nDecades before, a nearby tree had fallen, its roots knocking loose the modified tooth, which was recovered and saved.\n\nThe two people were probably of the same generation, or perhaps a generation apart, Parno said, both condemned to short, harsh lives in captivity.\n\nIt is possible that other burials may already have been lost to the river, and that others may be nearby, the experts said.\n\nEither way, Bush said: \"This could be a place that you could come and know that you could directly commune with individuals who we know were brought directly from the homeland to here, and were interred to return back to that same place.\"",

He will be sworn in on June 20.\n\nMayor Kelly Jennings said Johns' \"extensive law enforcement background and dedication to protecting communities is both admirable andinvaluable, aligning perfectly with our city's core value of prioritizing public safety.\n\n\"As we move forward, the entire City Council is committed to working together in a positive, respectful, and constructive manner that focuses on the well-being and high quality of life that our residents expect and deserve,\" Jennings said in a statement.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Rains said she could not longer serve in the current environment and it had \"become clear that I am the right person at the wrong time in our community.\" She had resigned earlier in the year as mayor, a role chosen among the council members.\n\nIn May, Councilmember Stephanie Winstead was appointed by the council to fill another vacancy left open when former Councilman Rischi Paul Sharma resigned in April.\n\nWinstead previously served on several city committees and is a real estate attorney. She also spoke about the importance of preserving the community's quality of life.\n\nWinstead had come in third behind councilmembers Stephanie Oddo and Ray Gennawey in November's election.\n\nWinstead and Johns will serve the remainder of the terms that end with the November 2024 election.\n\nJohns served as a deputy sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for 31 years - 24 of those years as a task force officer assigned to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. He commanded a task force nationally recognized for disrupting and dismantling drug cartel operations, according to the city's announcement.\n\nJohns moved to Laguna Niguel when he retired seven years ago. He and his wife, also a law enforcement veteran, discovered the area after attending conferences in Dana Point. Johns, who then lived in Redondo Beach after growing up in Torrance, said he liked the spaciousness of the area and its proximity to wilderness parks.\n\nThe minute he moved to town, he said, he wanted to be involved with the city. After looking around, he decided the Traffic and Transportation Commission would be best.\n\n\"Everything in the city revolves around traffic and transportation,\" Johns said. \"Residents, businesses and people coming into town are all affected.\"\n\nJohns said he was \"totally\" shocked when the council majority - Councilmember Stephanie Oddo opposed - chose him from a field of \"amazing people who applied.\"\n\nHe decided to put his name in, he said, because he has plans for running for council in 2024.\n\nHe said he's very interested in what happens with the Chet Holifield Federal Building, more commonly referred to as the Ziggurat. The building near Alicia Parkway has been a landmark in south Orange County for half a century, but is being sold by the government.\n\nLike the new development proposed for Town Center at City Hall, Johns said he'd like to be involved with what happens when a developer buys the Ziggurat property and moves forward with it.\n\nWhen he takes the dais, Johns said, he will \"listen and learn.\"\n\n\"I want to make sure I've done my homework,\" he said, \"and am ready to go.\"",

          "title": "Gov't Mule embraces Pink Floyd, peace and protest: \"We're in some pretty precarious times\"",
          "body": "Guitarist Warren Haynes discusses new album's complex song arrangements, touring and \"Dark Side of the Mule\"\n\nWarren Haynes is one of the greatest practitioners of rock and roll in the history of the artform. He consistently ranks on \"best guitarist\" lists, playing with a hard rock intensity and jazz-like virtuosity. At the same time, he amplifies a deep, soulful voice, enabling him to cover everything from Led Zeppelin to Otis Redding.\n\nOver the past 35 years, Haynes has channeled his sizable skills into the creation of an unrivaled resume: He was in the Allman Brothers Band for 25 years, he toured with The Dead, and most significantly, he and the late bassist Allen Woody, who was also in the Allman Brothers, founded Gov't Mule in 1994. With drummer Matt Abts, Mule's intention was to make one record and tour behind it as a side project. Things did not go according to plan. Gov't Mule has never stopped making records and touring the world. They are a staple of the jam scene, and like the Grateful Dead and The Allman Brothers, play unpredictable shows full of improvisation and surprise set choices. Planting a flag in their own territory, they manage to combine the influences of Black Sabbath and Ray Charles into one cohesive presentation.\n\nThey are currently touring to support their new record, \"Peace . . . Like a River,\" a diverse collection of lively and intricate songs. Taking a dip in the rivers of soul, gospel, jazz, blues and rock and roll, Gov't Mule's new songs navigate the search for inner peace, as well as the fight for peace and justice in American politics. \"Same As It Ever Was\" and the 10-minute epic \"Made My Peace\" give complex aural summary of self-discovery, taking listeners down many musical twists and turns. \"Dreaming Out Loud,\" with lyrics heavily inspired by the speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King, President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy (Sr.) and John Lewis, enlists guest vocalists, Ruthie Foster and Ivan Neville, to cry out for racial harmony, while \"Long Time Coming\" celebrates recent protest movements for racial and environmental justice.\n\n\"Peace . . . Like a River\" is a riveting record, demonstrating Gov't Mule's quest to challenge themselves and their audience with music that is as soulful as it is imaginative.\n\nI recently interviewed Warren Haynes, lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter for Mule about the new record, changes in mainstream music culture, and the band's upcoming tour, \"Dark Side of the Mule,\" which will feature a set paying tribute to Pink Floyd.\n\nGov't Mule album \"Peace ... Like a River\" (Fantasy)The new record \"Peace . . . Like a River\" has a variety of sounds and influences, and yet still sounds like vintage Gov't Mule. What was the process of creating the sound of the new record?\n\nWell, it all starts with the writing process. During COVID, when we were all in our houses, I had so much time to write that I had more new material than I've had in a long time. I made a conscious effort to bring back the concept of more complex song arrangements. I was thinking of some of our early stuff, like \"Left Coast Groovies,\" and some of our songs that have many moving parts. But more importantly, I was thinking about sounds that have influenced us that have many moving parts. All of our favorite stuff from the late '60s and early '70s didn't adhere to the modern-day formula of verse-chorus-verse-chorus. Some of the songs, instead of having two or three sections, would have seven or eight. They'd have tempo changes and key changes. And I thought it might be nice to bring that back - more intricate arrangements. The first four songs on this record really portray that. \"Same as It Ever Was,\" \"Shake Our Way Out,\" \"Made My Peace\" and \"Peace I Need\" are all good examples of challenging the modern-day short attention span.\n\nWhen you wrote some of those songs, you composed the complex arrangements? It wasn't something that came out of the recording?\n\nYes, for the most part I wrote the songs that way. Some things changed when we got into recording, but I went into the songs with the mindset of not limiting myself. During the whole lockdown, a lot of the songs that I wrote, I'd write on a guitar, and get all these ideas for different sections and parts, and record them, sometimes, on my phone, just so I would not forget them when we got into rehearsal. I had not had that kind of time in so many years that it was great to think that way.\n\nSo it was a silver lining in an otherwise terrible circumstance?\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nYou mentioned \"shot attention span.\" Why do you think that mainstream music culture has changed from the time when a sprawling epic with a complex arrangement could get on the radio to now you almost never hear that, and often the songs that you do hear are two minutes and 30 seconds with the same loop repeated over and over? What do you think accounts for that change?\n\nIt is a combination of a lot of things. Technology always helps dictate those kind of negative changes, negative in my mind. But also it is up to the artists and musicians to fly in the face of the trends. I made a joke with someone recently that if songs get any shorter, they won't even have a verse. They'll be nothing but a chorus. I think back to songs like \"Band On the Run\" or \"Bohemian Rapsody\" or \"Roundabout,\" even the radio versions of those songs had so many moving parts, and for whatever reason, people didn't have trouble following it. It was interesting and it maintained your attention. There was no reason to question it, because it was exciting and creative. I'd like to see the music world get back to that, because individuals as music lovers, as long as something is exciting, they're not going to be bothered by something conflicting with the norms and modern-day approach. People who really love music always embrace something that it is new, different and fresh.\n\nAnd welcome the surprise.\n\nYes, I remember many of the songs that I loved, I loved because I could hear how different they were from the songs surrounding them.\n\nWhen you attribute many \"negative changes\" to technology, would you draw a connection between shorter and more repetitive songs and fewer entertainers playing instruments?\n\nThose things are definitely tied together. We're starting to see more young people playing instruments and pursuing live performance. I'm hoping that it is a sign of a backlash against what Gov't Mule is rebelling against. You can see when you get on a plane, and it lands, everyone on the plane is looking at their phone. Some of them have legitimate reasons, but others are just jonesing. I remember when cell phones first became in vogue, you would see a person walking down the street on the phone, and everyone would mock him as someone drawing attention to himself. Now, everyone is on their phone.\n\nThat reminds me of the late Senator Danial Patrick Moynihan's phrase, \"Defining deviancy down.\"\n\nThat's right. I feel like the powers that be have become content to market to the lowest common denominator. Maybe that's always been the case, but it was, at least, to a lesser extent. There's not a lot of focus on music that enlightens people, and that carries over to other products as well.\n\nSomething else that jumped out about the new record, especially in comparison to your 2017 record \"Revolution Come . . . Revolution Go,\" which was angrier, is that it has a hopeful quality and mood. Is that feeling something you set out to inject into the songs?\n\nYeah, I did not want to write depressing, COVID-centric songs. I wanted to think about what was important in life, based on all the challenges we were going through. What would remain important? What could we let go of? It wasn't so much a conscious effort as it was what I found myself doing as I was writing. However, I did make sure not to write or record an album that was about how depressed we felt during COVID. There are songs like \"Shake Our Way Out\" and \"Head Full of Thunder\" that are definitely coming from a sense of humor sort of angle. All the ones that tie together, like \"After the Storm,\" \"Same As It Ever Was,\" and \"Peace I Need,\" are all exploring different aspects of an individual's search for inner peace.\n\nShervin Lainz (Shervin Lainz)\n\nAt the same time there are some political anthems like \"Dreaming Out Loud\" and \"Long Time Coming.\" Did you want to issue a comment on the various political crises? More broadly, why do consistently write protest songs? Every Mule record has, at least, one or two.\n\nRock and roll music has always reflected the times, and we're in some pretty precarious times. To ignore that is definitely the wrong thing. \"Revolution Come . . . Revolution Go\" was started, at least in the recording process, on election day of 2016, which forced us into a certain mindset. Here we are, years later, in a different predicament, but obviously America and the world in general are facing many challenges. I wanted to touch on those challenges in a few songs, but focus more on what we are all feeling together. Even though many of these songs are about my personal journey, I think they relate well to others, because during COVID, for the first time in my lifetime, everyone was facing the same fears and challenges.\n\nRelating to what you said earlier about music culture, what would you say has become of the album itself as a vehicle of music now that streaming has become the dominant listening format?\n\nIt's never going to be palatable for me to think of our audience only listening one track at a time. Right or wrong, I feel like we owe it to ourselves and our audience to put albums together with a thoughtful sequence and artwork that reflects the music. We want to keep that spirt alive. In some ways, that concept is coming back. Vinyl is outselling CDs now. It can't compare with streaming, but even many in the younger generation are excited about vinyl, and many young listeners are starting to get the concept of sequencing a record and why that is important. The instant gratification part of the equation, though, is that someone always has access to the feature track, and is going to start there. But many of our fans don't adhere to that mindset, and they look at music exactly the way we do.\n\nAs a writer, I often think of an album like I do a great book. You can pull a passage or chapter out of the book, and have a great reading experience, but nothing compares to reading the book in completion, and seeing how different parts interact and build off each other.\n\nRight, and for no other reason to get a glimpse into what the artist or the band was thinking in addition to the one featured track during that time period. It helps to know what else was going on in someone's mind other than one important thought that they had. Even if there was no concept to the record, a lot of our favorite records had songs that connected to each other because they developed in a single period during the artist or band's life.\n\nI would assume that one of your favorite records is Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" because you are getting ready for a \"Dark Side of the Mule\" tour this summer in which you'll play a Pink Floyd set every night. Why that particular record and why Pink Floyd for a tribute tour?\n\nFor us, \"Dark Side of the Mule\" is license to play anything from Pink Floyd we'd like, not only \"Dark Side of the Moon.\" Although, we do borrow heavily from that record. The fact that the 50th anniversary of that album is upon us is the impetus for doing the tour one last time. It is one of my favorite records. It is musically fantastic, and in some ways, better now than it was when it first came out. That's really the test of music. Is it timeless? Does it hold up in a modern light, in modern society? All the records that are our favorites do hold up, and allow us to learn something now that we didn't discover at its release. Pink Floyd's music is a good example of predicting what was to come.\n\nWhat are some of the other records that you would put alongside \"Dark Side of the Moon\"?\n\nThere's so many. All my favorite Led Zeppelin records, Little Feat records, Steely Dan records. Some of the great singer/songwriter records, like James Taylor's \"Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon,\" Jackson Browne's early records, Dylan's early records. I'm only scratching the surface. We won't even go into blues and jazz. In the blues and jazz world, from 1955 to 1965, there was an unbelievable flood of great music that stretched into the '70s. With rock and roll, from around 1966 or '67 to about 1973, there was just an amazing amount of classic, timeless music. I'm not sure why that was, but the soul music world was the same. If you look at the Marvin Gaye records, the Sly and the Family Stone records, and the Stevie Wonder records in that time period, they all have a timeless quality to them. When you hear them now, it doesn't feel like they were trying to copy anything. They weren't compromising or selling out. They were making music at the highest level possible for them.\n\nThis is a little tangential, but speaking of Pink Floyd, do you have any thoughts on the recent controversies surrounding Roger Waters?\n\nI don't really have any comment on that. I think Roger is one of the great songwriters of our time, and he has very strong political views - some that I agree with and some that I don't. But it doesn't change the music. I don't see any reason to shy away from the music, because he's controversial.\n\nGov't Mule live (Steven Addington)You're speaking about music history. You were in the Allman Brothers for 25 years, you toured with The Dead, and Gov't Mule is a pivotal part of the jam world. How do you describe the jam scene to the uninitiated? What does it mean to you?\n\nThe parameters of the jam world are loose and basic. The only real requirement is that you leave some of your songs open for reinterpretation on a nightly basis so that improvisation plays an important part in what you are doing. You play a different setlist night to night, rather than repeating that same set for the entire tour. You should include some strange cover choices, but also some obvious cover choices. There really aren't any strict musical rules. I've said for over 10 years that the jam world should incorporate more jazz, more reggae and more bluegrass, and it is finally starting to happen.\n\nGov't Mule is kind of the bastard child of the jam scene - the black sheep - because we're heavier than other jam bands. But we're still steeped in improvisation. It is interesting, because when we go to Europe, they don't have the same understanding and appreciation of the jam band scene. Some people are starting to get it, but the reason we do well in Europe, is they look at us as a rock and roll band - the same way they might look at The Black Crowes. In other parts of the world, they haven't really fully gotten into what the jam scene is all about, and that's understandable, because it is a bit bizarre. But, if you are open-minded as a music lover, I would suggest that you will realize it has something to offer.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nSo many rock and roll legends have died recently. You often write thoughtful tributes on your social media when a legend dies. How do you assess the legacy and meaning of rock and roll, as this is happening?\n\nIt is a bit scary that so many of the people that created the music we fell in love with are no longer with us. I would like to think that the timelessness, importance and integrity of it will inspire people to keep it alive. I hope that people realize the difference between trendy music and timeless music. There is always a place for pop music, but there's always a place for music that aspires to go beyond that, and to offer music lovers something much more challenging and inspired.\n\nAnd after writing songs about the search for inner peace, how would you say that experience changed your approach to making music?\n\nI feel like we're in the beginning of a new chapter. There's a lot of inspiration right now. We all should feel liberated. Personally, we're thankful for our chemistry as a band, and thankful for the opportunity to do what we love.",

          "body": "Michael Bay might not be helming the Transformer franchise anymore, but that doesn't mean it's going out of fashion anytime soon. Especially if Epic has anything to say about it. Rocket League's latest addition includes the one and only Bumblebee, although it looks nothing like the '70s Chevy Camaro model from \"Rise of the Beasts.\" An Optimus truck wouldn't have hurt either, but you can find him in Fortnite at the moment, hidden on the last page of the Battle Pass. 9 photosPhoto: Rocket League Fortnite's recent collaboration with Transformers introduced the leaders of the Autobots and Maximals, Optimus Prime, and Optimus Primal, respectively. Speaking from experience, playing either of them on PC with the graphics turned up to 11 is a very cool experience.\n\nSadly, Optimus doesn't \"roll out\" and turn into a truck, but you can find one that looks like his vehicle form and drive it. It's not ideal, but at least it's the closest you'll get to a good current-gen Transformers game. At least until the upcoming Transformers: Reactivate hits shelves sometime in 2024 or 2025.\n\nLeaving Epic's Fortnite aside for a moment and switching to the company's other major successful live-service game, Rocket League, let's see what the collaboration looks like.\n\nThe game will feature the Transformers Bundle until June 27, putting you in Bumblebee's driver's seat. As a cute little party trick, the not-Camaro can make him dance during the Post-Game Spotlight screen if you're into that sort of shenanigans.\n\nYou have to win for that to happen, but if you end up as the MVP, you'll see him do a rare animation. Just keep in mind that he can't perform these party tricks during a match.\n\nThe bundle also includes an animated Blueprint Bumblebee Player Banner and a powerful-sounding Engine Audio to make your enemies quiver in their tires. Then you have the Transformers Theme Player Anthem and the Optimus Prime Goal Explosion that completes the whole package.\n\nBefore you get excited, there is a price to pay, like with every live-service game. The Transformers Bundle is 2500 credits and features everything I listed above about the yellow muscle car.\n\nThen there is the Optimus Prime Goal Explosion stand-alone package for 800 Credits and the Transformers Theme Player Anthem for 300 Credits.\n\nAside from the excellent gameplay from Fortnite and Rocket League, the other major factor that makes these two games bring in incredible amounts of cash year after year is their ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of pop culture or meta.\n\nTo thrive in today's harsh gaming industry, you have to appeal to the mass market, and that's exactly what Epic Games has been doing since 2017 when they first came out with Fortnite as a more cartoony PUBG clone.",

          "title": "With Ja Morant suspended, so are Grizzlies' plans for NBA title chase",
          "body": "The Memphis Grizzlies put their future and title hopes in the hands of Ja Morant.\n\nWith Morant suspended, so are the franchise's championship plans.\n\nThe NBA has sidelined Morant for the first 25 games of the upcoming season. The suspension Friday of Memphis' franchise player was not unexpected for an organization that has made headlines for players' off-court issues and on-court antics.\n\nThe association still is a league where the best players matter.\n\nJeff Van Gundy, the former NBA coach and current ESPN and ABC analyst, said there are lot of questions about how much the Grizzlies will matter without their best player.\n\n\"Are they healthy? Are they unselfish? Are they driven? And can they make enough right decisions to lead an organization?\" said Van Gundy, who believes Memphis has strong leadership in general manager Zach Kleiman and an outstanding coaching staff led by Taylor Jenkins.\n\nBut Van Gundy added everything centers around their point guard and that \"hopefully for Morant ... he makes the right choices.\"\n\nHe has shown he can on the court.\n\nMorant has been the Grizzlies' biggest star; he was their first NBA Rookie of the Year in 2020 and the 2022 NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year. His No. 12 jersey ranked among the NBA's top 10 best sellers on the league website the second half of this season, and Nike gave Morant a signature shoe deal.\n\nOff the court, there has been a slew of questionable decisions.\n\nMorant, 23, flashed a handgun not once, but twice between March 4 and May 13 all caught on social media video. The second came after an eight-game suspension in March that allowed Morant to be back for the playoffs.\n\nPart of Morant's latest punishment is dealing with what Commissioner Adam Silver called \"destructive behavior.\" The Grizzlies issued a terse statement, noting all team personnel are expected to follow NBA and Memphis standards.\n\nWith Morant leading the way, Memphis has had regular season success but mostly playoff disappointment for fans and the organization.\n\nThey were good enough to be the Western Conference's No. 2 seed the past two postseasons with only playoff series win. They lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round in April.\n\nNow what the team will look like by the time next season comes around is unclear.\n\nThe Grizzlies have limited flexibility under the salary cap after doling out big contracts to Jaren Jackson Jr., this season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year, then Morant.\n\nThey do have the 25th pick overall in Thursday night's NBA draft, but Memphis already has decided not to bring back Dillon Brooks as a free agent after he led the league in technicals along with suspensions and fines. Brooks called LeBron James old as the Grizzlies lost in six games to the Lakers. Brooks was suspended for a game in the series and fined for not talking to the media.\n\nCenter Steven Adams never returned after hurting his right knee hurt in late January. Key reserve Brandon Clarke tore his left Achilles tendon March 3 -- hours before Morant earned his first suspension for livestreaming himself flashing a gun at a Denver-area strip club.\n\nBut because Morant has never played more than 67 games in a regular season, the Grizzlies do have experience playing without him.\n\nWith Morant, the Grizzlies are 142-106 (.573) in the regular season since he arrived in Memphis. They are 37-24 (.607) without him in the lineup.\n\nIronically, Morant missed 25 games during the 2021-22 season due to injuries and Memphis went 20-5.\n\nThis past season, however, the Grizzlies was just 11-10 without Morant and 40-21 with him.\n\nVan Gundy said Tyus Jones is a big reason Memphis has had success without Morant. With Jones under contract for the upcoming season, that's a bonus for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"He knows when Morant comes back he's the franchise player and so I don't think that'll be a problem,\" Van Gundy said of Jones' understanding he will be just be a part-time starter until the two-time All-Star's return.\n\nBut Jones, like everything about the Grizzlies at the moment, is just a temporary solution.\n\nTheir future hinges on Morant -- the point guard with \"otherwordly talent\" -- correcting his behavior and responsibly addressing issues away from basketball.\n\nVan Gundy said supporters are hoping for a good outcome, \"but the only one in charge of that is Morant.\"",

          "title": "See the Wildwoods' vintage Doo Wop motels lit up at night in all their neon glory",
          "body": "Traveling to the Wildwoods is like going back in time.\n\nNeon reigns supreme, angled roofs are everywhere and there are a plethora of plastic palm trees. While it may be 2023 everywhere else, in the Wildwoods it still looks like the 1950s and '60s.\n\nThe Wildwoods are the Doo Wop capital of the world and they're proud of it.\n\n\"It's part of the Wildwood trademark,\" Dan MacElrevey said in 2019 when he was president of the Doo Wop Preservation League in Wildwood.\n\nWHILE YOU'RE IN THE WILDWOODS... Our bucket list: 21 things to do to have the ultimate Jersey Shore vacation\n\nDoo Wop started out as a term to describe a subsection of rhythm and blues, which emphasized harmonies and often had nonsensical lyrics. The group The Turbans used the phrase \"doo wop\" in the chorus for its song \"When You Dance\" in 1955. As Doo Wop grew in popularity, it became more than just a genre -- eventually evolving into a term to encompass a look and feel of the time period of its heyday.\n\nSo why Doo Wop in Wildwood?\n\n\"That's when Wildwood went through a new era,\" MacElrevey said. \"We had our founding period 100 years ago, but after World War II there was an explosion of development in Wildwood.\"\n\nAround that time, Wildwood became the birthplace of rock and roll. It was there in 1954 that Bill Haley and the Comets debuted their hit \"Rock Around the Clock,\" which would go on to become the first rock and roll single to the Billboard \"Best Sellers\" pop chart, according to the New Yorker. The first national broadcast of \"American Bandstand\" was filmed in the Starlight Ballroom in Wildwood on Aug. 5, 1957. Chubby Checker busted out his song \"The Twist\" at the long-gone Rainbow Club in Wildwood in 1960.\n\nWildwood was rock and roll.\n\nMost of the city's historic motels started popping up around the same time, taking on the aesthetic trends of the time.\n\n\"Today, when you build a motel or a condo, it's just a box,\" MacElrevey explained. \"Here, they have slanted roof sand palm trees to make them more interesting and unique.\"\n\nIn 1997, that rock and roll past, combined with the historic motels became wrapped into one with the creation of the Doo Wop Preservation League. It's not your average historical preservation society, as it also is there to encourage new buildings to follow the Doo Wop look.\n\nAlso, don't confuse the vintage look with the motels and their furnishings being antiques.\n\n\"Don't misunderstand, just because it's Doo Wop doesn't mean it has to be old,\" MacElrevey said. \"It's not old, it's the style from the period.\"\n\nThe newer buildings hop in on the theme too. Wildwood has a 1950s-looking Wawa, an Acme with a 1950s sign and even a retro-fitted Walgreens. The McDonalds just got a set of 1950s arches too. Newer resorts also stay with the theme.\n\nThe Doo Wop look is a win for everyone.\n\n\"It makes the resort unique,\" MacElrevey said. \"It gives it its own character and identity, which does mean to us occupancy. Occupancy is profit and success and people come back year after year because they like staying in a place that's fun.\"\n\nDoo Wop can be boiled down to a few points, according to the Doo Wop Preservation League. They include a \"crazy high reader sign\" (preferably with lots of neon), kidney-shaped pool with plastic palm trees, colorful and curvy balcony railings, \"Jetson\" decorations and a creative night lighting scheme, motel lounge in the shape of an object (be it a spaceship or beach ball). Also important: \"[putting] this all together in an idiosyncratic, original and crazy way that clashes, jumps and jives.\"\n\nYou can learn more about Wildwoods and Doo Wop at the Doo Wop Experience Museum (4500 Ocean Ave.). You can also attend one of the museum's tours at 8 p.m. departure from the Doo Wop Experience Museum. Tours are Tuesdays and Thursdays and cost $20 for adults and $10 for children 12 and under.

          "title": "Bob Huggins DUI updates: Details of West Virginia basketball coach's arrest in Pittsburgh",
          "body": "West Virginia men's basketball coach Bob Huggins was arrested and charged with DUI in Pittsburgh on Friday, according to a report from the Pittsburgh Police Department. He has since been released.\n\nHuggins, WVU's coach since 2007-08, previously faced a DUI arrest in 2004 while still coach at Cincinnati; he was not retained following the 2004-05 season, and accepted a $3 million buyout.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the details of Huggins' arrest:\n\nMORE: Bob Huggins keeps job after calling Xavier fans homophobic slur\n\nAccording to an arrest report from the Pittsburgh Police Department, Huggins' black SUV was observed in the middle of the road blocking traffic at roughly 8:30 p.m. local time on Friday; the driver's side door was open, and the vehicle had a \"flat and shredded tire.\"\n\nOfficers directed Huggins on how to move off the road so they could help him with his tire, at which point they observed him having difficulty \"maneuvering\" his vehicle. They activated their lights and pulled him over under the suspicion of being intoxicated.\n\nPer the report:\n\nThey asked him to exit the vehicle to perform standard field sobriety tests, which he failed. The male was placed in custody without incident and transported for further testing.\n\nRobert Huggins, 69 , of Morgantown, West Virginia was charged with Driving Under the Influence. He was released from custody and will appear for a preliminary hearing at a later date.\n\nThe report does not mention the details of Huggins' release, including whether he had to pay bond.\n\nThe University of West Virginia has yet to release a statement regarding Huggins' arrest. However, Sports Illustrated's Pat Forde and Ross Dellenger -- citing sources inside the program -- reports officials are \"aware of the situation and are gathering more information.\"\n\nThe arrest is the latest issue facing the embattled Mountaineers coach, who was suspended three games in early May after calling Xavier fans a homophobic slur on a radio show.\n\nIt is uncertain what it means for Huggins at West Virginia moving forward. As part of his reinstatement, WVU stipulated in May that \"any similar incidents in the future will result in immediate termination.\"\n\nHuggins has led the program to 11 NCAA Tournament berths and one Final Four appearance since taking over in 2006.",

          "title": "2024 Lexus GX vs. G-Class, Defender, and Escalade, a Clash of Tough 4x4 Titans",
          "body": "After a long line of Toyota introductions, which culminated with the arrival of the mind-blowing 2024 Tacoma mid-size pickup truck destined to clash with the Ranger Raptor and Colorado ZR2 Bison in 326-hp i-Force Max hybrid TRD Pro format, it was only logical that the Lexus premium division should take over its rightful place on the red carpet and under the spotlight. 49 photosPhoto: Lexus / Cadillac / Mercedes-Benz / Land Rover So, they started in Europe with the preamble - their smallest crossover SUV to date, the 2024 Lexus LBX. That model is twinned with the Toyota Yaris Cross Hybrid - and it is not the only recent rebadge case. Over across the big pond - aka the Atlantic Ocean - the premium Japanese automaker featured a stunning double ensemble by presenting the 2024 TX and 2024 GX on the same day. The first-ever 2024 Lexus TX family-oriented three-row SUV and the third-gen 2024 Lexus GX rugged off-roader both look fearless - but should they really be?\n\nAs far as the TX is concerned, its biggest foe might not be all the other three-row family-oriented mid-size crossovers from rivals, but rather its Indiana sibling - the 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander. Luckily, Lexus was wise to give the TX its own personality, at least when seen from the front and rear - not from the side or the cockpit. It also has a tad more power than its Toyota counterpart when using the same powertrain options plus a plug-in hybrid flagship, the TX 550h+ variation.\n\nBut we are not here to discuss the trials and tribulations of badge engineering. Instead, we need to focus on the third-generation Lexus GX rugged SUV. This model has been around for over two decades and shows no signs of fatigue now that Lexus fans and specialists worldwide have unanimously approved it. Currently, there is only one powertrain to discuss, the GX 550, and there is also no sign of V8 oomph. That's the bad news - the good one is that the 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6 has 349 hp, 479 lb-ft (649 Nm) of torque, and when hooked to a ten-speed Direct Shift automatic transmission and full-time 4WD allows for a towing capacity ranging between 6,780 lbs. (3,075 kg) and 8,000 lbs. (3,629 kg), depending on trim, plus some excellent approach/breakover/departure angles.\n\nPhoto: Lexus By the way, the latter have a direct connection with the all-new Overtrail and Overtrail+ grades, which are basically the counterparts of Toyota's new Trailhunter trim. Moving on, the design slapped on top of the body-on-frame TNGA-F platform shared with the J300 Toyota Land Cruiser, XK80 Sequoia, XK70 Tundra, and N400 Tacoma, as well as the J310 Lexus LX is more than appreciated for its simplicity, ruggedness, and tough modernism. Two-tone paint options are also a go on the model that is usually twinned with the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado across many international markets. Plus, the interior is also contemporary, with a digital instrument cluster and a giant infotainment touchscreen without actually throwing any snazzy and useless gizmos in the driver's face. However, it is only natural that the upcoming 2024 GX 550 faces an uphill battle against some of the toughest off-road-focused big SUVs available on the US market.\n\nOne natural foe is the iconic Mercedes-Benz G-Class, as they are comparable in size (4,950 mm or 194.9 in. for GX, up to 4,817 mm or 189.6 inches for Gs), feature a rugged boxy styling that's charming to some and poisonous to others, plus both have legendary off-road capabilities enabled by their body-on-frame chassis setups. Another natural trait for these two is the hefty pricing format, which sees the G-Class SUV starting at no less than $140k in the United States. The owner gets the G 550 version for that kind of cash, as the AMG G 63 is even costlier with a starting MSRP of $179k. Anyway, the G 550 suffices for this quick comparison as it towers above the V6-powered GX 550 with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that's good for many additional ponies - 416 hp. Interestingly, the GX has a tad more torque with 479 lb-ft (649 Nm) than the mighty G550 and its 450 lb-ft (610 Nm) V8, so perhaps a drag race between the two would be more than balanced - both on tarmac and in an off-road environment.\n\nOf course, one of the most significant advantages of the renowned G-Class is that one does not need to wait long before having one in front of the garage or on the driveway. In contrast, the 2024 GX does not even have a price list for its numerous trims available just yet. Oh well, the same can be said about the next foe, too, as the 2023 Land Rover Defender 110 is also up for grabs - and from a much lower quotation of just $60,600. Of course, we need not compare 2.0-liter P300 i4 apples with twin-turbo V6 GX 550 oranges, so let's upgrade the $67,900 Defender S to the 3.0-liter P400 i6 powertrain, which mixes MHEV technology with 395 horsepower for quick sprint times of 5.8 seconds to 60 mph (96 kph). That's not bad at all, right? And if you want even more oomph, the 5.0-liter Defender SE with 493 hp rocks a sensible $93k starting price if you do not want to go down the Defender V8 route with 518 hp from $111,500.\n\nFrankly, if Lexus doesn't come out with a great pricing strategy, that Defender foe will be hard to beat, right? But what about some American competition? Well, the choice is quite complex - you could easily go down the route of the latest Jeep Grand Cherokee (WL) for a storied foe, but the problem is that it's a unibody creation and will not keep up with the GX when the off-road going gets inherently tough. Meanwhile, the bigger Ram 1500 body-on-frame-based Jeep Wagoneer (WS) is too large, even without considering the L model with its extended wheelbase. So, that probably leaves us with just one usual suspect - the fifth-generation Caddy Escalade! So, which one is your choice - the GX 550, G 550, Defender 110 P400, or the mighty Escalade - which rocks its 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine like a walking advertisement of the 'no replacement for displacement' motto?",

          "title": "With Ja Morant suspended, so are Grizzlies' plans for NBA title chase",
          "body": "The Memphis Grizzlies put their future and title hopes in the hands of Ja Morant.\n\nWith Morant suspended, so are the franchise's championship plans.\n\nThe NBA has sidelined Morant for the first 25 games of the upcoming season. The suspension Friday of Memphis' franchise player was not unexpected for an organization that has made headlines for players' off-court issues and on-court antics.\n\nThe association still is a league where the best players matter.\n\nJeff Van Gundy, the former NBA coach and current ESPN and ABC analyst, said there are lot of questions about how much the Grizzlies will matter without their best player.\n\n\"Are they healthy? Are they unselfish? Are they driven? And can they make enough right decisions to lead an organization?\" said Van Gundy, who believes Memphis has strong leadership in general manager Zach Kleiman and an outstanding coaching staff led by Taylor Jenkins.\n\nBut Van Gundy added everything centers around their point guard and that \"hopefully for Morant ... he makes the right choices.\"\n\nHe has shown he can on the court.\n\nMorant has been the Grizzlies' biggest star; he was their first NBA Rookie of the Year in 2020 and the 2022 NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year. His No. 12 jersey ranked among the NBA's top 10 best sellers on the league website the second half of this season, and Nike gave Morant a signature shoe deal.\n\nOff the court, there has been a slew of questionable decisions.\n\nMorant, 23, flashed a handgun not once, but twice between March 4 and May 13 all caught on social media video. The second came after an eight-game suspension in March that allowed Morant to be back for the playoffs.\n\nPart of Morant's latest punishment is dealing with what Commissioner Adam Silver called \"destructive behavior.\" The Grizzlies issued a terse statement, noting all team personnel are expected to follow NBA and Memphis standards.\n\nWith Morant leading the way, Memphis has had regular season success but mostly playoff disappointment for fans and the organization.\n\nThey were good enough to be the Western Conference's No. 2 seed the past two postseasons with only playoff series win. They lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round in April.\n\nNow what the team will look like by the time next season comes around is unclear.\n\nThe Grizzlies have limited flexibility under the salary cap after doling out big contracts to Jaren Jackson Jr., this season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year, then Morant.\n\nThey do have the 25th pick overall in Thursday night's NBA draft, but Memphis already has decided not to bring back Dillon Brooks as a free agent after he led the league in technicals along with suspensions and fines. Brooks called LeBron James old as the Grizzlies lost in six games to the Lakers. Brooks was suspended for a game in the series and fined for not talking to the media.\n\nCenter Steven Adams never returned after hurting his right knee hurt in late January. Key reserve Brandon Clarke tore his left Achilles tendon March 3 -- hours before Morant earned his first suspension for livestreaming himself flashing a gun at a Denver-area strip club.\n\nBut because Morant has never played more than 67 games in a regular season, the Grizzlies do have experience playing without him.\n\nWith Morant, the Grizzlies are 142-106 (.573) in the regular season since he arrived in Memphis. They are 37-24 (.607) without him in the lineup.\n\nIronically, Morant missed 25 games during the 2021-22 season due to injuries and Memphis went 20-5.\n\nThis past season, however, the Grizzlies was just 11-10 without Morant and 40-21 with him.\n\nVan Gundy said Tyus Jones is a big reason Memphis has had success without Morant. With Jones under contract for the upcoming season, that's a bonus for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"He knows when Morant comes back he's the franchise player and so I don't think that'll be a problem,\" Van Gundy said of Jones' understanding he will be just be a part-time starter until the two-time All-Star's return.\n\nBut Jones, like everything about the Grizzlies at the moment, is just a temporary solution.\n\nTheir future hinges on Morant -- the point guard with \"otherwordly talent\" -- correcting his behavior and responsibly addressing issues away from basketball.\n\nVan Gundy said supporters are hoping for a good outcome, \"but the only one in charge of that is Morant.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hubba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

          "body": "Eviction filings are far above pre-pandemic levels in many cities across the country as pandemic relief disappears and inflation causes rents to spike By MICHAEL CASEY and R.J. RICO - Associated Press\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Entering court using a walker, a doctor's note clutched in his hand, 70-year-old Dana Williams, who suffers serious heart problems, hypertension and asthma, pleaded to delay eviction from his two-bedroom apartment in Atlanta.\n\nAlthough sympathetic, the judge said state law required him to evict Williams and his 25-year-old daughter De'mai Williams in April because they owed $8,348 in unpaid rent and fees on their $940-a-month apartment.\n\nThey have been living in limbo ever since.\n\nThey moved into a dilapidated Atlanta hotel room with water dripping through the bathroom ceiling, broken furniture and no refrigerator or microwave. But at $275-a-week, it was all they could afford on Williams' $900 monthly social security check and the $800 his daughter gets biweekly from a state agency as her father's caretaker.\n\n'We have to be perfect to win': Cardinals are out of the race until they outrun their mistakes Holleman: Frustrated vehicle vigilante in St. Louis rips expired temporary tag from car Tempers flare as Cardinals get routed 11-3 in fourth straight loss as Giants clinch series Kirkwood lawyer sentenced for faking court orders, judges' signatures in 'betrayal' of clients Hochman: It's never been this bad for a Cardinals team that's supposed to be good Shark attack in Egypt kills Russian swimmer in terrifying incident caught on video St. Charles Community College readies new campus in Wentzville.

Most low-income tenants can no longer count on pandemic resources that had kept them housed, and many are finding it hard to recover because they haven't found steady work or their wages haven't kept pace with the rising cost of rent, food and other necessities.\n\nHomelessness, as a result, is rising.\n\n\"Protections have ended, the federal moratorium is obviously over, and emergency rental assistance money has dried up in most places,\" said Daniel Grubbs-Donovan, a research specialist at Princeton University's Eviction Lab.\n\n\"Across the country, low-income renters are in an even worse situation than before the pandemic due to things like massive increases in rent during the pandemic, inflation and other pandemic-era related financial difficulties.\"\n\nEviction filings are more than 50% higher than the pre-pandemic average in some cities, according to the Eviction Lab, which tracks filings in nearly three dozen cities and 10 states. Landlords file around 3.6 million eviction cases every year.\n\nAmong the hardest-hit are Houston, where rates were 56% higher in April and 50% higher in May. In Minneapolis/St. Paul, rates rose 106% in March, 55% in April and 63% in May. Nashville was 35% higher and Phoenix 33% higher in May; Rhode Island was up 32% in May.\n\nThe latest data mirrors trends that started last year, with the Eviction Lab finding nearly 970,000 evictions filed in locations it tracks -- a 78.6% increase compared to 2021, when much of the country was following an eviction moratorium. By December, eviction filings were nearly back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAt the same time, rent prices nationwide are up about 5% from a year ago and 30.5% above 2019, according to the real estate company Zillow. There are few places for displaced tenants to go, with the National Low Income Housing Coalition estimating a 7.3 million shortfall of affordable units nationwide.\n\nMany vulnerable tenants would have been evicted long ago if not for a safety net created during the pandemic.\n\nThe federal government, as well as many states and localities, issued moratoriums during the pandemic that put evictions on hold; most have now ended. There was also $46.5 billion in federal Emergency Rental Assistance that helped tenants pay rent and funded other tenant protections. Much of that has been spent or allocated, and calls for additional resources have failed to gain traction in Congress.\n\n\"The disturbing rise of evictions to pre-pandemic levels is an alarming reminder of the need for us to act -- at every level of government -- to keep folks safely housed,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, urging Congress to pass a bill cracking down on illegal evictions, fund legal help for tenants and keep evictions off credit reports.\n\nHousing courts are again filling up and ensnaring the likes of 79-year-old Maria Jackson.\n\nJackson worked for nearly two decades building a loyal clientele as a massage therapist in Las Vegas, which has seen one of the country's biggest jumps in eviction filings. That evaporated during the pandemic-triggered shutdown in March 2020. Her business fell apart; she sold her car and applied for food stamps.\n\nShe got behind on the $1,083 monthly rent on her one-bedroom apartment, and owing $12,489 in back rent was evicted in March. She moved in with a former client about an hour northeast of Las Vegas.\n\n\"Who could imagine this happening to someone who has worked all their life?\" Jackson asked.\n\nLast month she found a room in Las Vegas for $400 a month, paid for with her $1,241 monthly social security check. It's not home, but \"I'm one of the lucky ones,\" she said.\n\n\"I could be in a tent or at a shelter right now.\"\n\nIn upstate New York, evictions are rising after a moratorium lifted last year. Forty of the state's 62 counties had higher eviction filings in 2022 than before the pandemic, including two where eviction filings more than doubled compared to 2019.\n\n\"How do we care for the folks who are evicted ... when the capacity is not in place and ready to roll out in places that haven't experienced a lot of eviction recently?\" said Russell Weaver, whose Cornell University lab tracks evictions statewide.\n\nHousing advocates had hoped the Democrat-controlled state Legislature would pass a bill requiring landlords to provide justification for evicting tenants and limit rent increases to 3% or 1.5 times inflation. But it was excluded from the state budget and lawmakers failed to pass it before the legislative session ended this month.\n\n\"Our state Legislature should have fought harder,\" said Oscar Brewer, a tenant organizer facing eviction from the apartment he shares with his 6-year-old daughter in Rochester.\n\nIn Texas, evictions were kept down during the pandemic by federal assistance and the moratoriums. But as protections went away, housing prices skyrocketed in Austin, Dallas and elsewhere, leading to a record 270,000 eviction filings statewide in 2022.\n\nAdvocates were hoping the state Legislature might provide relief, directing some of the $32 billion budget surplus into rental assistance. But that hasn't happened.\n\n\"It's a huge mistake to miss our shot here,\" said Ben Martin, a research director at nonprofit Texas Housers. \"If we don't address it, now, the crisis is going to get worse.\"\n\nStill, some pandemic protections are being made permanent, and having an impact on eviction rates. Nationwide, 200 measures have passed since January 2021, including legal representation for tenants, sealing eviction records and mediation to resolve cases before they reach court, said the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nThese measures are credited with keeping eviction filings down in several cities, including New York City and Philadelphia -- 41% below pre-pandemic levels in May for the former and 33% for the latter.\n\nA right-to-counsel program and the fact that housing courts aren't prosecuting cases involving rent arears are among the factors keeping New York City filings down.\n\nIn Philadelphia, 70% of the more than 5,000 tenants and landlords who took part in the eviction diversion program resolved their cases. The city also set aside $30 million in assistance for those with less than $3,000 in arears, and started a right-to-counsel program, doubling representation rates for tenants.\n\nThe future is not so bright for Williams and his daughter, who remain stuck in their dimly-lit hotel room. Without even a microwave or nearby grocery stores, they rely on pizza deliveries and snacks from the hotel vending machine.\n\nWilliams used to love having his six grandchildren over for dinner at his old apartment, but those days are over for now.\n\n\"I just want to be able to host my grandchildren,\" he said, pausing to cough heavily. \"I just want to live somewhere where they can come and sit down and hang out with me.\"\n\nCasey reported from Boston.

          "title": "[OPINION] Could Iran emerge as the beneficiary of Erdoğan's new cabinet? - Turkish Minute",
          "body": "Turkish series negatively portrays jailed philanthropist in line with gov't narrative\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was sworn in for a third term in office and announced his new cabinet earlier this month, pivoting towards a security-centric, proactive foreign policy approach in the MENA region. The notable appointments include Hakan Fidan, previously the Turkish spy chief, now taking up the mantle of the country's foreign minister, and Erdogan spokesman İbrahim Kalın transitioning to the role of the new head of the intelligence agency. The political journey of both Fidan and Kalın intersects with Turkish Islamists who have shown robust support for Iran's Islamic Revolution, potentially hinting at the future direction of Turkey's foreign policy.\n\nDuring his tenure at the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) since 2010, Fidan steered the agency through significant transformations. The integration of the latest technology and broad expansion of the institution under his leadership played a crucial role in Turkey's military and diplomatic engagements in such places as the Caucasus, Ukraine, Syria and Libya. As the Justice and Development Party (AKP) pursues its pragmatic foreign policy, Fidan's new role may involve securing political or military victories against neighboring countries, which could serve as a distraction from Turkey's internal issues, in particular economic crises and high rates of inflation.\n\nHowever Fidan, despite being Turkey's top diplomat, has always been a mysterious figure, rarely interacting with the media. This, coupled with his rapid ascension from a noncommissioned officer in the Turkish army to the head of a security institution -- a trajectory unheard of in the Turkish bureaucracy -- has left many unanswered questions. His close association with politicians such as former interior minister Beşir Atalay and former prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, who are believed to be sympathetic towards Iran, only adds to the intrigue.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey's new spy chief Kalın has consistently emphasized the importance of Iran as a neighbor for Turkey. Kalın's educational background and affiliations align him with figures like Davutoğlu and other Islamist politicians. These ties, along with his tenure as general coordinator of SETA, an AKP think tank founded by Davutoğlu, suggest a continuity in the policy approach.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Turkey's Sunni-dominated political culture, figures like Davutoğlu, Fidan and Kalın have shown a considerable amount of sympathy towards Shiite Iran, a surprising stance considering the historical power struggle between Turkic and Iranian entities in the region. This attitude reinforces Davutoğlu's foreign policy mantra of \"Zero problems with neighbors,\" which strongly advocated improved relations with Iran.\n\nIt's noteworthy that a leaked recording from 2014 features Fidan proposing a contentious approach towards Syria. However, in his current role, he seems more inclined towards fostering peace with the Assad regime. Despite the AKP's apparent shift towards a more aggressive foreign policy -- visible through the occupation of northern Syrian cities, an increased military presence in northern Iraq and involvement in conflicts in the Caucasus, Ukraine and Libya - the direction in which Kalın and Fidan might steer Turkey's foreign policy remains uncertain.\n\nWhile it is still too early to make definitive predictions, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian's quick and enthusiastic response to Fidan's appointment as foreign minister suggests a potentially favorable turn in Iran-Turkey relations.",

During a special Disney Channel-themed episode of her latest podcast, Baby, This is Keke Palmer, the new mother revealed that she wasn't a big fan of High School Musical when it debuted in 2006.\n\nThe beloved franchise, starring Zack Efren and Vanessa Hudgens, stole the hearts of kids and teens around the world, but the feeling didn't quite resonate with Palmer.\n\n\"For me, it was High School Musical,\" the former Disney star confessed to her guests Aly and AJ. \"Yuck! And no offense because I have so many friends from that cast.\"\n\nWhen it comes to musicals, Palmer can appreciate the element of surprise. The Chicago native said that she wasn't into watching musicals where the characters burst into song mid-conversation.\n\n\"I didn't like how stuff was always like that [in HSM]. I'm very weird with musicals. It's so strange. It has to hit me at the right time and the right vibe,\" she clarified. Then, the Big Boss artist poured more salt into the wounds of High School Musical fans when she claimed that the film was \"nothing but Grease.\" But the Nope actress admitted that there were a few songs from the film that she still loves hearing today.\n\nThe multi-hyphenate began to recite the lyrics to \"Break Free,\" a hit song from the first High School Musical film sung by Drew Seeley.\n\n\"'Cause that was the gag! For years, people thought it was Zac Efron singing on that first High School Musical. They done edited in him a voice. A blue-eyed brother with some soul, honey! Drew Seeley was eating those songs up!\" the mother of one revealed.\n\nAfter reflecting on Seely's killer vocals, Palmer changed her tune about the popular Disney film. \"Maybe I did like High School Musical,\" she laughed.\n\nOne user thought it was \"crazy\" that the celeb didn't enjoy the popular franchise.\n\nAnother fan seemed shocked to learn that it wasn't really Zac Efron singing in the adored film. \"They had Drew Seeley behind the curtain SANGING for yearssss,\" the user added.\n\nJT, one half of the City Girls,\" confessed, \"Same, I hated High School Musical but it seemed popular idk.\"\n\nHigh School Musical alum Vanessa Hudgens took the actress's remarks about the film in stride. \"Lol, I love u,\" the star wrote.\n\nPalmer may not be a fan of musicals, but over the last few weeks, the actress and singer has shown that she loves sporting a mean outfit and a beat face.\n\nShe also recently attended the Fragrance Foundation Awards, and that ensemble gave body for days.\n\nWe love to see it!",

He learned the ropes of his sport and honed his skills with the help of veteran trainers and coaches Mamerto Aventurado and Emilio \"Toto\" Lacanaria.\n\nArreglado said he didn't have the confidence to compete at first and he was also shy. He later found his niche in athletics and built his confidence over time.\"Ang plano gyud nako ato kay mangita og scholarship aron makapadayo ko'g eskwela tapos muundang nako (I planned to find a scholarship so that I can continue school then quit being an athlete),\" Arreglado said during the iSpeak media forum held Thursday, June 15, at the Davao City Hall conference room.\n\nBut as time went by, he learned to love competing in various para-games competitions. He recalled, \"Nagtuloy-tuloy na gyud to. Pagka-graduate nako, wala na nako giundang akong sport. Naging passion na gyud nako, sige lang ko'g dula.

          "title": "Steely Dan's Donald Fagen picks his greatest influences",
          "body": "Despite their incessant performance of the hokey cokey with the fashionable side of music, one thing that cannot be denied is Steely Dan's impressive command of their instruments. The duo of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker may be constantly fighting a ebb and flow of appreciation from the musical world, with the band arguably one of the most polarising groups in the history of rock and roll, but they know what they're doing in the studio.\n\nIt makes sense too. When you go looking for the influences of most preeminent rock musicians from the 1970s, the vast majority will have put their faith in the explosive moment The Beatles set foot on American soil or the mind-bending alternate realities created by Pink Floyd, the sultry cool of The Doors or the bombastic, hip-shaking joie de vie of The Rolling Stones. However, for Donald Fagen at least, the real pillars of his musicianship could be found in jazz.\n\nOf course, he isn't the only musician of the time to find their musical roots nestled in the bedrock of the most movable genre ever created. Pink Floyd's own Rick Wright almost exclusively listened to the off-beat tunes of the 1950s and '60s jazz musicians, and so too did The Rolling Stones sticks-man, Charlie Watts. However, it feels all the more pertinent coming from Fagen and the guitar band that changed the direction of rock and roll with a string of prog-infused songs such as 'Peg', 'Kid Charlemagne' and 'Deacon Blues' -- all three created while punk began to catch fire on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nFagen was honest about the jazz musicians who had affected his work when he sat down with New York magazine in 2006, sharing: \"I basically listen to the same 40 albums that I listened to in high school, near Princeton. I had much better taste then. I was a kid jazz fan. I only like seven or eight of the greatest artists: Sonny Rollins, Charles Mingus, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk ... And I like big-band arrangers, like Gil Evans. There's a band called the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra that I used to like for the arrangements.\"\n\nThe artists would directly affect Fagen's writing of pop songs, too: \"Most pop music, nothing much happens; you'll hear something, and it's repeated. I like when there's some development. The jazz arrangers of the '50s and '60s really knew how to develop a piece of music.\"\n\nFor many, the names mentioned above will be as notable as John Lennon, Bob Dylan, and the latest pop stars. For others, they will read simply as a list of obscure promises of greatness. Below is a playlist that should make good on those faint covenants. Starting with the mercurial Sonny Rollins is always a great place to start. Born in 1930, the jazz saxophonist has enjoyed a seven-decade career which includes 60 albums and some of the most notable jazz compositions of the 20th century. Pieces such as 'St Thomas', 'Airegin' and 'Doxy' have all become standards.\n\nIf you were to ask for the ultimate jazz musician's jazz musician, Charles Mingus would likely enter every conversation you started. Born in 1922 and with a three-decade career before he died in 1979, Mingus' talent far outshone his abilities as a bassist and pianist, and he is most notable for his impressive collaborations. A pioneer of collective improvisation, Mingus worked with Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, among a ream of other iconic names.\n\nPerhaps the most famous name on Fagen's list is the mercurial Miles Davis. One of the most beloved jazz musicians of all time, rock musicians have routinely cited Davis as a gigantic influence on their work. His aptitude for pushing the envelope creatively connected him with the rock and roll spirit that emerged in the 1960s and beyond. Dropping out of Julliard to gig with Charlie Parker, Davis' Birth of Cool is considered one of the greatest albums ever made.\n\n'Round Midnight', 'In Walked Bud' and 'Blue Monk' are just three of the compositions Thelonious Monk added to the set of jazz standards. Born in 1917, the pianist exuded a suave demeanour that drew him close to his fans' hearts. Unlike other musicians, Monk rarely took himself too seriously, often wearing hats, shades and suits while performing and even stopping his shows to have a little boogie himself mid-set.\n\nThe final two names on Fagen's list are a little less known. Gil Evans' role as one of the pioneers of jazz definition should not be underestimated. The Canadian was instrumental as a bandleader in developing the sub-genres of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz and jazz fusion. Equally, Sauter-Finegan Orchestra are a little-known swing band who found their fame in the 1950s with songs such as 'Doodletwon Ffers' and more. Led by Julliard-trained Eddie Sauter and Bill Finnegan, the group were known for their inventiveness.\n\nWhile a brief introduction to some of the pivotal figures in Steely Dan maestro Donald Fagen's, life is all well and good, the best way of understanding how these musicians may have changed the young Fagen's musical panache is to listen to their music. Below, we have a perfect playlist comprised of their most enigmatic compositions.",

          "title": "With Ja Morant suspended, so are Grizzlies' plans for NBA title chase",
          "body": "The Memphis Grizzlies put their future and title hopes in the hands of Ja Morant.\n\nWith Morant suspended, so are the franchise's championship plans.\n\nThe NBA has sidelined Morant for the first 25 games of the upcoming season. The suspension Friday of Memphis' franchise player was not unexpected for an organization that has made headlines for players' off-court issues and on-court antics.\n\nThe association still is a league where the best players matter.\n\nJeff Van Gundy, the former NBA coach and current ESPN and ABC analyst, said there are lot of questions about how much the Grizzlies will matter without their best player.\n\n\"Are they healthy? Are they unselfish? Are they driven? And can they make enough right decisions to lead an organization?\" said Van Gundy, who believes Memphis has strong leadership in general manager Zach Kleiman and an outstanding coaching staff led by Taylor Jenkins.\n\nBut Van Gundy added everything centers around their point guard and that \"hopefully for Morant ... he makes the right choices.\"\n\nHe has shown he can on the court.\n\nMorant has been the Grizzlies' biggest star; he was their first NBA Rookie of the Year in 2020 and the 2022 NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year. His No. 12 jersey ranked among the NBA's top 10 best sellers on the league website the second half of this season, and Nike gave Morant a signature shoe deal.\n\nOff the court, there has been a slew of questionable decisions.\n\nMorant, 23, flashed a handgun not once, but twice between March 4 and May 13 all caught on social media video. The second came after an eight-game suspension in March that allowed Morant to be back for the playoffs.\n\nPart of Morant's latest punishment is dealing with what Commissioner Adam Silver called \"destructive behavior.\" The Grizzlies issued a terse statement, noting all team personnel are expected to follow NBA and Memphis standards.\n\nWith Morant leading the way, Memphis has had regular season success but mostly playoff disappointment for fans and the organization.\n\nThey were good enough to be the Western Conference's No. 2 seed the past two postseasons with only playoff series win. They lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round in April.\n\nNow what the team will look like by the time next season comes around is unclear.\n\nThe Grizzlies have limited flexibility under the salary cap after doling out big contracts to Jaren Jackson Jr., this season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year, then Morant.\n\nThey do have the 25th pick overall in Thursday night's NBA draft, but Memphis already has decided not to bring back Dillon Brooks as a free agent after he led the league in technicals along with suspensions and fines. Brooks called LeBron James old as the Grizzlies lost in six games to the Lakers. Brooks was suspended for a game in the series and fined for not talking to the media.\n\nCenter Steven Adams never returned after hurting his right knee hurt in late January. Key reserve Brandon Clarke tore his left Achilles tendon March 3 -- hours before Morant earned his first suspension for livestreaming himself flashing a gun at a Denver-area strip club.\n\nBut because Morant has never played more than 67 games in a regular season, the Grizzlies do have experience playing without him.\n\nWith Morant, the Grizzlies are 142-106 (.573) in the regular season since he arrived in Memphis. They are 37-24 (.607) without him in the lineup.\n\nIronically, Morant missed 25 games during the 2021-22 season due to injuries and Memphis went 20-5.\n\nThis past season, however, the Grizzlies was just 11-10 without Morant and 40-21 with him.\n\nVan Gundy said Tyus Jones is a big reason Memphis has had success without Morant. With Jones under contract for the upcoming season, that's a bonus for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"He knows when Morant comes back he's the franchise player and so I don't think that'll be a problem,\" Van Gundy said of Jones' understanding he will be just be a part-time starter until the two-time All-Star's return.\n\nBut Jones, like everything about the Grizzlies at the moment, is just a temporary solution.\n\nTheir future hinges on Morant -- the point guard with \"otherwordly talent\" -- correcting his behavior and responsibly addressing issues away from basketball.\n\nVan Gundy said supporters are hoping for a good outcome, \"but the only one in charge of that is Morant.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hubba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

          "title": "5 WWE stars who could still get added to the Money in the Bank Ladder Match",
          "body": "WWE has determined all six competitors in the Men's Money in the Bank ladder match, but the same cannot be said about the women's ladder match. WWE will determine the fifth and sixth competitor for the women's match next week on RAW and SmackDown respectively, though they may have already spoiled their pick from the Red brand.\n\nFans might be wondering how come WWE still has two slots left with Money in the Bank just around the corner. It is worth mentioning that Bayley was the fifth woman to qualify for the match, but ended up getting worked by IYO SKY into putting her spot on the line against Shotzi. The two women will meet next Friday on SmackDown.\n\nAs far as the men's ladder match is concerned, WWE determined the sixth competitor for the bout this past Monday on RAW when Damian Priest defeated Matt Riddle in their qualifier. We also saw signs of rift between members of The Judgment Day after Finn Balor got his World Heavyweight Championship match against Seth Rollins at Money in the Bank.\n\nIt is possible that WWE could add another participant to the ladder match. Last year, Vince McMahon had Austin Theory walk in as the surprise seventh contestant. The current United States Champion ended up walking away with the green briefcase. Theory, however, joined the illustrious list of superstars who failed to cash-in their contract.\n\nHaving said that, let's take a look at five stars who could still get added to the Money in the Bank ladder match:\n\nLogan Paul hasn't been seen since he lost to Seth Rollins in a thrilling contest at WrestleMania 39. The Maverick is set to return to RAW next week, leading fans to wonder if he could be added to the Men's Money in the Bank ladder match.\n\nPaul is no stranger to taking high-flying risks and the ladder match just happens to provide the right opportunity for him to showcase his crazy athletic abilities. It remains to be seen if the social media megastar will find his way to the O2 Arena in London.\n\nDrew McIntyre continues to remain a hot topic even though he hasn't appeared on WWE television since WrestleMania 39. There were reports of alleged differences between the Scottish Warrior and his employer with regard to his contract.\n\nThe rumors were seemingly put to rest after Ridge Holland gave an update about Drew McIntyre's future in WWE. The former WWE Champion is one name fans would love to see return as a surprise entrant at the Men's Money in the Bank ladder match.\n\nShotzi lost to IYO SKY in the women's Money in the Bank ladder match qualifier on the June 9, 2023, episode of WWE SmackDown. All hope seemed lost for the Blackheart until she found a way to re-enter the much-anticipated contest.\n\nShotzi challenged Bayley to put her spot on the line during a backstage segment on the latest edition of the blue brand. IYO SKY accepted the challenge on her partner's behalf and the match was officially booked for SmackDown next week.\n\nRaquel Rodriguez wasn't booked for Money in the Bank and that annoyed her fans. However, things took a rather surprising turn after the powerhouse was booked to face Trish Stratus in a Women's Money in the Bank ladder match qualifier.\n\nThe two women will meet inside the ring next Monday on RAW. It will be a huge opportunity for the former NXT Champion as she takes on a WWE Hall of Famer in Trish Stratus. It remains to be seen if the Quintessential Diva will stop Big Mami Cool in her tracks.\n\nTrish Stratus hasn't held a world title in years, but that doesn't mean she never will. The WWE Hall of Famer will square off against Raquel Rodriguez in the women's ladder match qualifier next week on RAW.\n\nTrish could get added to the women's Money in the Bank ladder match on July 1st by overcoming the powerhouse. It remains to be seen if the Quintessential Diva will get help from her protégé Zoey Stark or see her plans ruined by her bitter rival.",

          "title": "Ron DeSantis finally has Donald Trump on the defensive. Keep it up",
          "body": "Donald Trump became the first former president to face a judge on federal charges as he pleaded not guilty in a Miami courtroom Tuesday to dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding classified documents and refusing government demands to give them back. (June 14)\n\nNews helicopters chased Donald Trump's motorcade as it wound its way to the Miami courthouse on Tuesday.\n\nReporters interviewed supporters and protesters and speculated on what was happening inside. The only thing the circus lacked was Trump arriving in a white Bronco.\n\nAs the former president's superfans criticized the Department of Justice and Joe Biden, they flung most of their contempt at a guy who had nothing to do with the case: Ron DeSantis.\n\nTrump mouthpiece Alex Bruesewitz tweeted, \"No statement from DeSanctimonious today. Coward!\"\n\nTurning Point USA head Charlie Kirk took to Twitter, as well. \"Every 'Republican' running for President should suspend their campaign and go to Miami as a show of support .... show solidarty [sic] or we will mark you as part of the oppsition [sic].\"\n\nFor his part, DeSantis criticized the \"weaponization of federal law enforcement\" and the \"uneven application of the law.\"\n\nNeedless to say, he didn't suspend his campaign.\n\nStill, even GOP Trump skeptics criticized DeSantis for only obliquely commenting on his legal troubles, insisting the governor stop \"pulling his punches.\"\n\nBut DeSantis has a very good reason not to focus all his energies on the Orange One. Being a former Naval officer, he understands something called the OODA Loop.\n\nWhile in the U.S. Air Force, fighter pilot Col. John R. Boyd created a decision-making model that allowed American pilots to dominate every dogfight.\n\nMarshaling his exhaustive knowledge of big thinkers from Sun Tzu to Werner Heisenberg, Boyd determined that victory isn't merely a matter of superior technology and firepower. More important are brainpower, decisiveness and fast choices.\n\nOODA stands for Observation, Orientation, Decision, Action.\n\nThe pilot must quickly observe the conditions, orient his jet before the opponent does, decide upon a plan, and then act against the enemy's weakness. The faster through this cycle, the better.\n\nAfter the pilot's initial decision, he immediately observes the new environment, reorients himself, decides a second move, and acts on it.\n\nBy employing this framework, Boyd promised he could best any of his fellow pilots despite starting a mock battle in a vulnerable position. He achieved his goal every time in less than 40 seconds.\n\nIn other words, it's not necessarily the best decision that wins, but the fastest. This forces the opponent to react to you, not the other way around.\n\nThe OODA loop is as applicable to business and politics as it is to dogfights.\n\nIf you run a tech company, success isn't merely having the best product, being fastest to market, or having the largest marketing budget. Those are helpful, but the essential element is to outmaneuver the competition.\n\nBy taking fast, decisive action, you can get inside your opponent's OODA loop, which Boyd said will \"make us appear ambiguous, [and] thereby generate confusion and disorder.\"\n\nLike what Bill Barr said about Trump? Read his thoughts on Jan. 6\n\nTrump is the one used to creating \"confusion and disorder.\" In 2016 and ever since, he makes his opponents react to him, thus setting the agenda for the entire campaign.\n\nThe media covers him nonstop, whether it's for the petty insult of the day, a false claim or a court case.\n\nWhen reporters do cover his rivals, they mostly ask them about Trump's latest outrage. Nearly all of his opponents' decisions have been defensive, responding to the front-runner.\n\nThis campaign, Trump is the one reacting. Even when DeSantis doesn't say a word.\n\nThis is a distinct advantage for the governor for the long haul.\n\nFor the first time in Trump's political life, another candidate has gotten inside his OODA loop, putting him on the defensive and, eventually, forcing him into costly mistakes.\n\nIf DeSantis maintains this strategy, it bodes well for a primary victory.",

A while back, we brought you Ramayana maker Ramanand Sagar's Prem Sagar's reaction to the film and bashed the director for tampering with the facts. Now the latest one to react to the same is Sunil Lahri.\n\nSunil played one of the pivotal roles of Lakshmana in Ramanand's Ramayana alongside 'Lord Ram' aka Arun Govil and 'Sita' Dipika Chikhlia. Here's what he said. Read on\n\nTaking to Instagram, Sunil Lahri shared a couple of dialogues by Hanuman, Raavan and others from Adipurush and called it shameful. He wrote alongside, \"\"कहते हैं फिल्म आदि पुरुष रामायण को ध्यान में रखकर बनाई गई है अगर यह सच है तो इस तरह की भाषा का प्रयोग बहुत शर्मनाक है. If it is true, film adipurush was made keeping Ramayan in mind, then the use of such language (dialogues) is very shameful...\"\n\nReacting to Sunil Lahri's post, a user wrote, \"Sab Islamic log hai ye Bollywood wale sanatan ko halala ki paidaish hai\" while another said, \"Ramanand Sagar jaisa na kabhi banega na kabhi bana hai jai shree ram\"\n\nA third user wrote, \"#boycott adipurush .....aap bilkul sahi ho sir ...astha ka majak bana rakha hai ..jai shree ram.\" A fifth one said, \"Laxman ji aap shrap de do Om Raut ko\" Check out the post below:\n\nMeanwhile, Adipurush writer Manoj Muntashir defended the dialogues at a recent interview and told Republic, \"A very meticulous thought process has gone into writing the dialogues for Bajrangbali. We have made it simple because we have to understand one thing (that) if there are multiple characters in a film, all of them can't speak the language. There has to be a kind of diversion, a division.\"\n\nComing back, what are your thoughts on the same? Have you watched the film yet? Do let us know. Meanwhile, stay tuned to Koimoi for more updates!",

          "title": "The Frankenstein Chatbots are Erupting",
          "body": "Will the People Counter with Ethical and Enforceable Legal Frameworks?\n\nRick Claypool is a level-headed policy analyst and number-cruncher for Public Citizen, who is known for reporting the decline in corporate crime enforcement with each succeeding Presidency. (Biden less than Trump). His latest report (with Cheyenne Hunt) clearly shows him in an unusually agitated state. Its title is \"'Sorry in Advance!' Rapid Rush to Deploy Generative A.I. Risks a Wide Array of Automated Harms.\"\n\nClaypool is not engaging in hyperbole or horrible hypotheticals concerning Chatbots controlling humanity. He is extrapolating from what is already starting to happen in almost every sector of our society.\n\nI challenge you to read his report without experiencing cognitive dissonance and throwing up your hands thinking the genie is already out of a million bottles. Claypool takes you through \"... real-world harms [that] the rush to release and monetize these tools can cause - and, in many cases, is already causing.\"\n\nClaypool's analysis takes you through five broad areas of concern, excluding the horrific autonomous weapons the Department of Defense (aka the Department of Offense) is deeply involved in developing. The various section titles of his report foreshadow the coming abuses: \"Damaging Democracy,\" \"Consumer Concerns\" (rip-offs and vast privacy surveillances), \"Worsening Inequality,\" \"Undermining Worker Rights\" (and jobs), and \"Environmental Concerns\" (damaging the environment via their carbon footprints).\n\nBefore he gets specific, Claypool previews his conclusion: \"Until meaningful government safeguards are in place to protect the public from the harms of generative A.I., we need a pause.\" Just how, he doesn't say. Because with so many increasing generators of these Chatbots around the world, this flood of Frankenstein Chatbots may present a problem the Dean of the Harvard Law School, Roscoe Pound, described regarding the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the 1920s as being beyond \"the limits of effective legal action.\"\n\nClaypool quotes Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, who released last November the shocking ChatGPT A.I. product, saying afterward: \"I think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary ones.\" Altman has been busy up on Capitol Hill mesmerizing legislators by saying \"regulation is needed\" by which he means the industry itself writing the rules and standards for Congress.\n\nUsing its existing authority, the Federal Trade Commission, in the author's words \"... has already warned that generative A.I. tools are powerful enough to create synthetic content - plausible sounding news stories, authoritative-looking academic studies, hoax images, and deepfake videos - and that this synthetic content is becoming difficult to distinguish from authentic content.\" He adds that \"...these tools are easy for just about anyone to use.\" BIG TECH is rushing way ahead of any legal framework for AI in the quest for big profits, while pushing for self-regulation instead of the constraints imposed by the rule of law.\n\nThere is no end to the predicted disasters, both from people inside the industry and its outside critics. Destruction of livelihoods, harmful health impacts from promotion of quack remedies, financial fraud, political and electoral fakeries, stripping of the information commons, subversion of the open internet, faking your facial image, voice, words, and behavior, tricking you and others with lies every day. AI's potential for deception will make Fox News' deceptions look comparatively restrained.\n\nWith Congress and the White House issuing unenforceable exhortations to the industry to be nice, safe and responsible, critics are looking to the European Union's first stage passage of an A.I. Act to protect its people from the more overt damages to their common and individual rights and interests. The Act's focus is on which uses of A.I. need to be curbed, including the adverse impact on elections. It mandates the labeling of A.I.-generated content. On May 16, 2023, Public Citizen petitioned the Federal Election Commission to issue a rule preventing the use of AI to deceive voters.\n\nAll legislative bodies will have to confront the barriers of secrecy - claims by governments on weapons and surveillance development and the already asserted \"trade secrets\" by corporations. In the U.S., there will also be First Amendment defenses for free speech by these artificial entities called corporations. Their corporate lawyers will have a lucrative field day concocting delays and obstructions.\n\nOur nation and the world are barely organized enough to control through treaties the use of nuclear weapons - through treaties, poorly prepared for devastating pandemics, and virtually nowhere in foreseeing and forestalling the mega-threats of generative A.I. \"to society and humanity.\" Those were the words of an open warning letter calling for a six-month pause, signed by top CEOs (such as Elon Musk), technologists and academics.\n\nWith few exceptions, a lazy Congress, readying for a long July 4 holiday break followed by taking off all of August for a congressional recess, is oblivious to its special powers and duties to the American people. Let's see some congressional urgency to put some specificity and enforcement teeth behind and beyond Biden's nonbinding \"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights\" published by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in October 2022.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), who sits on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, is pushing for the creation of a new federal agency to regulate A.I. Technologies.\n\nFor now, I have two recommendations. Demand your Senators and Representatives join you for local town meetings during Congress's August recess where you and your lawmakers can listen to each other and address the pressing issues. Tell them that this run-away robotic juggernaut is stripping humans of their own mental identities, autonomy and self-reliant judgments.\n\nEveryone is at risk. Even Microsoft and Google have little idea of the whirlwind they are unleashing, driven by shortsighted profits, not wisdom, civic principles and accountabilities to public institutions and the people themselves. Have your local experts formulate the focus of the town meeting agendas, backed by your sense of urgency.\n\nThen demand that your members of Congress end their three-day a week work routine and conduct rigorous hearings in D.C. and around the country with a deadline for passing legislation. Tell them they, too, are at risk for the fakery, slander, and imitations of the Chatbots.\n\nLastly, upgrade and make more precise your skepticism toward the Chatbots already entering and affecting your lives and localities. Be on guard and develop an ever-larger circle of trusting relatives, friends, neighbors and coworkers.\n\nThe corporate Chatbots are coming on fast without any legal or ethical frameworks to restrain and discipline them from subverting your freedoms and true sense of realities.",

          "title": "Biden's rally with union workers will mark first big event of his 2024 campaign",
          "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Joe Biden plans to promote his pro-labor record Saturday at his first major political rally since he formalized his reelection campaign, appearing alongside union members to make the case that his economic agenda is boosting the middle class.\n\nHis campaign says Biden, who will appear at the Philadelphia Convention Center, will \"lay out the core principles of his economic message.\" The president also intends to talk about how a sweeping climate, tax and health care package he signed into law last year has cut the cost of prescription drugs and lowered insurance premiums. It's part of his administration's focus on his achievements during his first two years in office -- the centerpiece argument for a second term.\n\nSeveral of the nation's most powerful unions -- including the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- officially endorsed Biden's campaign on Friday. The first-of-its-kind joint endorsement among the unions and the backdrop of hundreds of workers are part of a meticulously choreographed effort to show the support of labor behind what Biden himself calls the most pro-union president in history.\n\n\"I'm saying that my philosophy about building from the middle out and the bottom up is working,\" Biden told reporters before a fundraiser in Connecticut on Friday evening.\n\nThe Philadelphia event also comes amid some encouraging economic news for Biden, with inflation cooling last month, continuing a steady decline in consumer prices primarily driven by lower gas prices, a smaller rise in grocery costs than in previous months and less expensive furniture, air fares and appliances.\n\nThe city and Pennsylvania have long been at the heart of Biden's political efforts. Philadelphia was the site of his campaign headquarters in 2020 and the state was one of a handful that had voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but flipped back to Democrats four years later.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said some union members supported Trump in the past because \"there is a lot of grievance in this country and there is a lot of unhappiness. And what Trump was a master at was being able to exploit fear and exploit grievance.\"\n\nShe said part of the reason the AFT and other top unions endorsed Biden nearly 18 months before Election Day 2024 was to promote Biden's economic record against Republican-championed cultural issues.\n\nBiden is \"going to feel very, very comfortable when he's in Philadelphia. He's going to be among friends,\" added Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. He pushed for a coordinated endorsement of Biden's reelection campaign from top unions early in the cycle.\n\nUntil now, Biden's primary campaign activity has been fundraising. He raised money at a private home in Greenwich, Connecticut, on Friday and soon will hold fundraisers in California, Maryland, Illinois and New York.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSuccess!

          "title": "Is There Now An Opportunity In The Hackett Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCKT)?",
          "body": "While The Hackett Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCKT) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a small cap stock, hardly covered by any analysts, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Hackett Group's outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Hackett Group\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It's trading around 19% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Hackett Group today, you'd be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company's true value is $26.57, then there's not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Hackett Group's share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you're looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let's also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -12% expected next year, near-term growth certainly doesn't appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Hackett Group. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.\n\nAre you a shareholder? HCKT seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you've been keeping tabs on HCKT for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there's less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven't considered today, which can help gel your views on HCKT should the price fluctuate below its true value.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Hackett Group (1 shouldn't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Hackett Group, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

          "body": "DEKALB COUNTY, Ga. - In a series of incidents at the DeKalb County Jail, law enforcement authorities recently thwarted multiple attempts to smuggle contraband into the facility. Arrests were made following the discovery of illegal items ranging from eyeglasses to marijuana.\n\nThe first incident occurred on June 11 when an inmate at the DeKalb County Jail awaited the arrival of contraband, including Versace eyeglasses, through a drop delivery. However, the operation was foiled when the string used to hoist the bag snapped mid-air, preventing the spectacles and other illicit items from reaching the intended recipient. Deputies from the DeKalb County Sheriff's Office obtained warrants leading to the apprehension of three individuals involved in the contraband attempt.\n\nAmong those arrested were Tremaine Ward, a 22-year-old resident of Atlanta, who faces charges of Conspiracy to Commit a Misdemeanor and Crossing State/County Guard Lines with Weapons, Intoxicants, Drugs without Consent, both of which are felonies. Additionally, Quintavious Chase, a 28-year-old Atlanta resident, was charged with Conspiracy to Commit a Misdemeanor and Criminal Trespass, both misdemeanors. Lastly, 18-year-old Miracle Smith, also from Atlanta, was charged with Conspiracy to Commit a Misdemeanor. All three suspects were safely transported to the DeKalb County Jail.\n\nFollowing this incident, two subsequent contraband drops were averted.\n\nOn June 15, deputies from the DeKalb County Sheriff's Office arrested three individuals after an alleged delivery person was left behind as his accomplices fled the scene in a vehicle.\n\nBlake Street, a 36-year-old Decatur resident, was apprehended near the jail as he attempted to run away. Additionally, Jazmyne Renee Howard, a 32-year-old resident of Snellville, and 29-year-old Snellville resident Broje Alexander Simmons were identified, located, and arrested nearby. Charges for the three individuals included Crossing State/County Guard Lines with Weapons, Intoxicants, Drugs without Consent for Blake, and Trespass - Unlawful Purpose for both Howard and Simmons. Once again, all suspects were transported without incident to the DeKalb County Jail.\n\nIn the latest incident, which occurred Friday, law enforcement apprehended 60-year-old Hertis Johnson of Riverdale outside the front entrance of the DeKalb County Jail. Mr. Johnson was found in possession of various contraband items, including marijuana and two Bridgeport summer sausages. He now faces charges of Crossing State/County Guard Lines with Weapons, Intoxicants, Drugs without Consent and Possession of Marijuana, both of which are felonies.\n\nThe seized items Johnson's possession were extensive, ranging from tobacco, cigarettes, and toiletries to cell phones, lighters, and bottles of Jack Daniels. The haul also included items typically associated with smuggling operations, such as SIM card removers, security bit sets, and rolling papers. In addition, packets of marijuana and a package of red beans and rice were discovered. Johnson was taken into custody without resistance and subsequently transported to the DeKalb County Jail.",

Geetha issues directive to all village and taluk-level officials under the Disaster Management Act, 2005\n\nThe processing of compensation requests for those who lost their houses in rain-related calamities will be made faster in Kozhikode district following a special directive issued by District Collector A. Geetha to all village and taluk-level officials under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.\n\nBased on the latest directive, the village officers concerned will have to ensure that the applications received at village offices for compensation reach the tahsildar's office in 10 days via the special relief portal. Also, the applications should be handed over to the local administrators concerned in two days for officially estimating the loss.\n\nThe local administrators too will be accountable for submission of the estimated loss to the village offices concerned in five days. If they fail to keep the deadline, it will be referred to the consideration of the District Disaster Management Authority for further action.\n\nThe tahsildars too have been asked to submit their reports to the District Collector in 48 hours after receiving the village-level reports. They will also be responsible for conducting additional review of the submitted requests within the specified time frame.\n\nArrangements are also in place to adopt measures even in the absence of formal written requests from the affected people for compensation. The village officers concerned will have to check directly with such individuals if they receive confirmed reports on damage to houses.\n\nThe new order comes in the wake of a series of complaints that pinpointed delay in disbursing compensation to eligible beneficiaries who suffered huge losses in rain-related calamities last year. There were also complaints of discrimination against some of the eligible beneficiaries.\n\nAs per the latest instructions from the Collector, Revenue officials will be responsible for upholding Section 61 (prohibition against discrimination) of the Disaster Management Act. While providing compensation and relief, officials who handle grievances will be bound to ensure that there shall be no discrimination on the grounds of sex, caste, community, descent, or religion.",

          "body": "LONDON (AP) -- King Charles III rode on horseback Saturday to take part in his first Trooping the Color ceremony as U.K. monarch, inspecting hundreds of soldiers and horses in a spectacular annual military display at central London's Horse Guards Parade.\n\nCharles, 74, the colonel in chief, received the royal salute and watched as the most prestigious regiments in the U.K. army paraded to mark his official birthday.\n\nIt was the first time in more than 30 years that a U.K. monarch has taken part in the pomp-filled ceremony on horseback.\n\nEarlier, Charles' eldest son, Prince William, and the king's siblings, Prince Edward and Princess Anne, also rode on horseback in procession from Buckingham Palace. All the royals were dressed in red and gold tunics and tall black bearskin hats, matching the uniforms worn by many of the 1,400 soldiers taking part.\n\nOthers in the royal family, including Queen Camilla, Kate, the Princess of Wales, and her three young children, rode in horse-drawn carriages as thousands of people thronged the Mall, the grand avenue outside Buckingham Palace, to watch the pageantry.\n\nHere are some things to know about the colorful spectacle:\n\nBIRTHDAY PARADE\n\nTrooping the Color is essentially a grand birthday parade to honor the reigning monarch. The annual ceremony is a tradition that dates back more than 260 years.\n\nHuge crowds turn out each June to watch the display, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace. The monarch then inspects their troops, including both foot guards and horse guards. Gun salutes and a crowd-pleasing military flyby over the palace typically round out the celebrations.\n\nCharles' actual birthday is Nov. 14, 1948. But U.K. monarchs have traditionally celebrate two birthdays -- their real one and an official one -- to ensure that public celebrations can take place in warm summer weather.\n\nCharles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, always held the Trooping the Color birthday parade in June, while she celebrated her actual April birthday privately with family.\n\n\"THE COLOR\"\n\nThe central part of the parade features a battle flag -- or the \"Color\" -- being displayed and marched past troops and the monarch.\n\nThis is a ceremonial reenactment of the way regimental flags were once displayed for soldiers on the battlefield to provide a crucial rallying point if they became disoriented or separated from their unit.\n\nThe flags were traditionally described as \"Colors\" because they displayed the uniform colors and insignia worn by soldiers of different units.\n\nA different flag is trooped each year. This year the \"Color\" was the King's Color of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards.\n\nKING ON HORSEBACK\n\nSaturday was the first time a monarch has ridden on horseback at the event since Elizabeth did so in 1986.\n\nThe queen rode her favorite horse, called Burmese, to 18 Trooping the Color ceremonies until the black mare retired in 1986. After that she decided to use a carriage for the event instead.\n\nCharles also rode on horseback for the spectacle last year, when as heir to the throne he inspected the troops on behalf of his mother. Elizabeth died last September at the age of 96.\n\nBONUS MILITARY FLYBY\n\nThe birthday parade typically reaches its climax when, at the end of the military procession, the royal family lines up on Buckingham Palace's balcony to watch a spectacular flyby.\n\nThe Royal Air Force's aerobatic team, the Red Arrows, usually wows the crowds as they fly in formation leaving plumes of red, white and blue vapor trails.\n\nThis year, the flyby was even more impressive, because a similar display on Charles' coronation day in May had to be scaled back because of bad weather. Around 70 aircraft took part Saturday, including Spitfire and Hurricane fighters from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.\n\nEighteen Typhoon fighter jets flying in precise formation spelt out \"CR\" -- \"Charles Rex\" -- in the sky as the royal family and thousands of spectators cheered.\n\nNewsletters\n\nSuccess!

          "body": "(The Center Square) - Several key leadership changes are taking place in the next few weeks at agencies primarily tasked with border security.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner Benjamine \"Carry\" Huffman and U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz are both retiring at the end of the month after serving for 38 and 32 years, respectively.\n\nTheir retirements come as they end their careers overseeing the greatest number of illegal entries at the southern and northern borders in United States history.\n\nIn the last few months of their tenure, the number of illegal border crossers totaled more than the individual populations of eight U.S. states. The number of known or suspected terrorists apprehended illegally entering U.S. borders was also a major concern during their tenure.\n\nIt was because of Ortiz's testimony during a deposition in a lawsuit filed by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody that the American people were first made aware of a Biden administration plan to release illegal foreign nationals en masse into the United States instead of detaining and deporting them in accordance with federal law.\n\nOrtiz also testified that Biden administration policies were causing illegal border crossings, and that there is a crisis at the southern border.\n\nIt was under Huffman's tenure that a new mobile app was launched to expand access for entry, the first of its kind in U.S. history. Moody also sued over this and other policies, winning more than once in federal court. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also sued to halt the use of the app and the policy of releasing illegal foreign nationals into the U.S. with immigration court dates three to four years out.\n\nRetiring at one of the most controversial times of their respective agencies, Huffman and Ortiz served under seven, and six presidential administrations, respectively. Both retire June 30.\n\nHuffman began his career with the U.S. Border Patrol in 1985, joined the Senior Executive Service in January 2014, and received multiple awards throughout his career. Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said, \"There is simply no greater champion of the men and women of CBP than Chief Huffman, and he leaves behind an incredible legacy of service spanning nearly four decades.\"\n\nExecutive Assistant Commissioner for CBP's Office of Field Operations, Pete Flores, will serve as Acting Deputy Commissioner of CBP starting July 1. He currently leads 31,000 uniformed and civilian personnel nationwide. He's held multiple leadership roles across the agency, including several in San Diego.\n\nDeputy EAC Diane Sabatino has been selected to fill his role as the Acting Executive Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Field Operations. In her more than 25-year career, she's led high-performing teams in Miami.\n\nOrtiz \"is a true leader who has worked tirelessly to ensure our Border Patrol agents have the tools, resources, and support they need to do their jobs,\" Miller said. Ortiz has also received numerous awards during his tenure, \"but the highest compliment we can bestow on him is that he is a great agent,\" he said.\n\nDel Rio Sector Chief Jason Owens has been appointed as the next chief of the U.S. Border Patrol. Owens has served for over 25 years, rising through the ranks holding key leadership positions. \"Owens has demonstrated consistent dedication to our border security and homeland security missions, and to the men and women who carry out these responsibilities every day,\" Miller said.\n\nOf the leadership transition, Miller said they all \"embody our agency's core values of vigilance, service to country, and integrity. They are entrusted with the critical responsibilities of protecting our national security and supporting our worldwide workforce: the incredible people who carry out our mission each and every day.\"\n\nNewsletters\n\nSuccess!

          "body": "Mobile gaming has come a long way since the early days of the 'Snake' game on Nokia phones to next-generation smartphones offering high-definition graphics and immersive gameplay that rival even the most popular console games.\n\nMobile gaming has evolved as much as the mobile device itself.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed during that time, the mobile gaming segment shone as it catered to the entertainment-seeking public eagerly, and the Indian mobile gaming market witnessed a boom during the period, which is still ongoing for the sector.\n\nDuring the waves of Covid-19, consumers made a significant shift towards online channels.\n\n\"The critical pillars of the economy, banking, and payments, witnessed a substantial increase in adoption, propelling India from being the third-largest gaming market to becoming the largest gaming market in the world. One in five mobile gamers resides in the country,\" Paavan Nanda, Co-Founder at WinZO games, told IANS.\n\nAccording to a recent report by marketing firm MoEngage, mobile gaming in India is expected to reach $8.6 billion by the end of 2027, owing to increased smartphone penetration, lower-cost smartphones, and more affordable data plans.\n\nThe report also estimated that the current valuation of the Indian gaming industry stands at $2.6 billion.\n\n\"India presents a significant opportunity for mobile gaming and is projected to become a $7 billion market by 2025. It is expected that 5 deacons and 10 unicorns will emerge in the sector, making it highly attractive for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) compared to any other sector,\" Nanda said.\n\nAs a mobile-first nation, India has seen a significant increase in mobile gaming in recent years due to a convergence of key trends such as powerful premium smartphones, improved data connectivity, the rise of a new breed of influencers, as well as influencer-driven user-generated content.\n\nPrabhu Ram, Head, Industry Intelligence Group, CyberMedia Research (CMR), said that these trends will continue, with both mobile and PC gaming gaining strength in the time ahead.\n\n\"Notably, there has been a rise in serious female gamers as well as increased gaming time amongst mobile gamers,\" Ram told IANS.\n\nBased on Lumikai's State of India Gaming Report 2022 in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), women spend on average 11.2 hours playing video games per week, while men spend 10.2 hours per week.\n\nThe survey found that 60 per cent of gamers were men, while 40 per cent were women.\n\nThese trends have contributed to a transition from casual to more serious and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nAs per CMR, around 5 in 6 smartphone users play games on their smartphones for stress relief (44 per cent) and leisure (41 per cent), and often immerse themselves in another character (26 per cent).\n\nAmong gamers, sports games are the most preferred (53 per cent), followed by action/adventure games (51 per cent).\n\nWhen playing games on their smartphones, battery life is crucial for seven out of eight gamers.\n\nIn addition, the advanced capabilities of current premium smartphones further enhance the overall gaming experience, enabling seamless and enjoyable gameplay of demanding mobile titles.\n\nIn 2022, a report by Statista, a German online platform specialised in data gathering and visualisation, showed that the mobile game population in India was over 174 million, and the number of mobile games downloaded was over 9.3 billion.\n\n(Shrey Srivastava can be reached at shrey.s@ians.in)",

          "body": "MUNICH, June 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Zhejiang Hyxi Technology Co., Ltd.

          "title": "Law Enforcement Agencies in Mississippi Have Acquired Millions of Dollars in Military Equipment",
          "body": "In recent years, images have proliferated in the media of American law enforcement intervening in protests - donning helmets, toting assault rifles, and marching alongside armored vehicles. While many Americans have been shocked by such displays, the militarization of police departments across the country is nothing new.\n\nIn the 1990s, an era of high crime marked by an escalation of the war on drugs in cities across the country, Congress authorized the National Defense Authorization Act, also known as the 1033 Program. Under the NDAA, state and local law enforcement agencies could procure excess military weapons and equipment from the Department of Defense.\n\nSince the program's inception, the DOD has transferred $7.6 billion in military equipment to law enforcement agencies across the country. And while law enforcement agencies do not pay for this equipment, they are responsible for costs related to shipping, maintenance, and storage. In recent years, every state except Hawaii has used the program to acquire excess military weapons and equipment.\n\nAccording to data from the Defense Logistics Agency, 44 law enforcement agencies in Mississippi acquired surplus military equipment between 2010 and the first quarter of 2023. To better reflect increasing militarization of American law enforcement, items determined by the DOD to present a \"low risk\" when released from federal control were not included in our analysis. Such items include tents, forklifts, firearm slings, picnic tables, and boots.\n\nThe combined value of this equipment, as measured by the original price paid by the military, totals $17,536,439 - the 21st least among the 49 participating states. The Marshall County Sheriff's Office received 9.6% of this equipment, as measured by its monetary value, the most of any law enforcement agency in the state.\n\nRankStateTotal value of military equipment acquired from 2010-2023 Q1 ($)Law enforcement agencies receiving military equipment1Texas129,382,4293242California109,660,1981543Tennessee107,079,8681974Florida74,563,0191375South Carolina74,094,8371356Alabama70,698,5391777Georgia61,462,7432018Arizona56,326,770759Ohio56,316,00723310Minnesota54,888,65111111Michigan49,981,06720112New Jersey45,460,06618413North Carolina45,455,13311114Wisconsin41,176,13110615Illinois40,028,90923516New York38,730,99011017Washington37,195,3848618Indiana35,940,90214119Missouri34,513,79217320Kentucky32,495,91114021Arkansas30,891,6469522Colorado28,770,88210323Oklahoma28,268,27512024Louisiana24,538,5655125Virginia23,784,9848426Pennsylvania21,863,8629827Oregon19,839,4493228Nevada19,582,3761929Mississippi17,536,4394430New Mexico17,076,2693831West Virginia15,865,1453432North Dakota15,580,6975433Connecticut14,845,9574934Utah13,604,1663635Iowa12,859,8335336Idaho11,265,3204637Nebraska9,472,0212338Maine7,804,4224539Massachusetts7,482,5795340South Dakota7,398,5983741Maryland5,797,4994542Montana4,836,0912243Kansas4,781,2474844Wyoming4,006,1411545New Hampshire3,645,8282746Alaska1,705,594347Rhode Island1,586,2841348Delaware991,5971149Vermont372,6616\n\nNewsletters\n\nSuccess!

          "body": "Weil sie in deutschen Supermärkten Zwiebeln vom anderen Ende der Welt fanden, wendeten sich Verbraucher an die Social-Media-Teams deutscher Supermarkt-Ketten.\n\nKassel - Es ist einer der großen Verbraucher-Trends unserer Zeit, dass man bei Lebensmitteln mehr und mehr auf Nachhaltigkeit achtet, auf Lieferwege, regional Hergestelltes und Angebautes und eine CO2-Bilanz, die gegengerechnet zum Preis zumindest vertretbar ist. Mehr und mehr Menschen - gerade in Deutschland - achten auf diese Faktoren, und mehr und mehr Supermärkte richten sich danach.\n\nEs gibt aber auch immer wieder Ausreißer und Negativbeispiele, die in Zeiten von Social Media dann natürlich auch umso schneller die Runde machen. Honig aus Mexiko, Äpfel aus Süddafrika und - aktuelles Beispiel - auch Zwiebeln aus Australien.\n\nDie fanden mehrere Kunden zuletzt etwa bei der Supermarkt-Kette Globus sowie in Kaufland-Märkten und posteten Bilder der Herkunftskennzeichnung im Netz. Einem User, der auf der Facebook-Seite von Kaufland ein Bild aus seinem Supermarkt hochlud mit der Frage \"Warum?\" erhielt vom Social-Media-Team den Rat, sich nochmal per E-Mail ans Kundenmanagement zu wenden. Kaufland gehört wie Lidl zur Schwarz-Gruppe.\n\nEin anderer Nutzer postete seinen Fund auf Twitter und fragte rhetorisch, ob Globus nicht gleich über ein \"Gewächshaus auf dem Mars\" nachdenken wolle.\n\nBei Zwiebeln handelt es sich um eine der Lebensmittelarten, die in Deutschland traditionell heimisch und ganzjährig verfügbar sind. Laut Informationen des Bundesinformationszentrums Landwirtschaft wurden in Deutschland etwa im Jahr 2021 von über 1600 Betrieben auf 14.500 Hektar Fläche Speisezwiebeln angebaut. Rund 664.000 Tonnen wurden geerntet.\n\nLuftlinie beträgt die Entfernung zwischen der australischen Hauptstadt Canberra und Berlin 16.073 Kilometer. (saka)",

          "title": "With Ja Morant suspended, so are Grizzlies' plans for NBA title chase",
          "body": "Ja Morant's immense basketball talents have transformed the Memphis Grizzlies into NBA title contenders\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies put their future and title hopes in the hands of Ja Morant.\n\nWith Morant suspended, so are the franchise's championship plans.\n\nThe NBA has sidelined Morant for the first 25 games of the upcoming season. The suspension Friday of Memphis' franchise player was not unexpected for an organization that has made headlines for players' off-court issues and on-court antics.\n\nThe association still is a league where the best players matter.\n\nJeff Van Gundy, the former NBA coach and current ESPN and ABC analyst, said there are lot of questions about how much the Grizzlies will matter without their best player.\n\n\"Are they healthy? Are they unselfish? Are they driven? And can they make enough right decisions to lead an organization?\" said Van Gundy, who believes Memphis has strong leadership in general manager Zach Kleiman and an outstanding coaching staff led by Taylor Jenkins.\n\nBut Van Gundy added everything centers around their point guard and that \"hopefully for Morant ... he makes the right choices.\"\n\nHe has shown he can on the court.\n\nMorant has been the Grizzlies' biggest star; he was their first NBA Rookie of the Year in 2020 and the 2022 NBA's Most Improved Player of the Year. His No. 12 jersey ranked among the NBA's top 10 best sellers on the league website the second half of this season, and Nike gave Morant a signature shoe deal.\n\nOff the court, there has been a slew of questionable decisions.\n\nMorant, 23, flashed a handgun not once, but twice between March 4 and May 13 all caught on social media video. The second came after an eight-game suspension in March that allowed Morant to be back for the playoffs.\n\nPart of Morant's latest punishment is dealing with what Commissioner Adam Silver called \"destructive behavior.\" The Grizzlies issued a terse statement, noting all team personnel are expected to follow NBA and Memphis standards.\n\nWith Morant leading the way, Memphis has had regular season success but mostly playoff disappointment for fans and the organization.\n\nThey were good enough to be the Western Conference's No. 2 seed the past two postseasons with only playoff series win. They lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round in April.\n\nNow what the team will look like by the time next season comes around is unclear.\n\nThe Grizzlies have limited flexibility under the salary cap after doling out big contracts to Jaren Jackson Jr., this season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year, then Morant.\n\nThey do have the 25th pick overall in Thursday night's NBA draft, but Memphis already has decided not to bring back Dillon Brooks as a free agent after he led the league in technicals along with suspensions and fines. Brooks called LeBron James old as the Grizzlies lost in six games to the Lakers. Brooks was suspended for a game in the series and fined for not talking to the media.\n\nCenter Steven Adams never returned after hurting his right knee hurt in late January. Key reserve Brandon Clarke tore his left Achilles tendon March 3 -- hours before Morant earned his first suspension for livestreaming himself flashing a gun at a Denver-area strip club.\n\nBut because Morant has never played more than 67 games in a regular season, the Grizzlies do have experience playing without him.\n\nWith Morant, the Grizzlies are 142-106 (.573) in the regular season since he arrived in Memphis. They are 37-24 (.607) without him in the lineup.\n\nIronically, Morant missed 25 games during the 2021-22 season due to injuries and Memphis went 20-5.\n\nThis past season, however, the Grizzlies was just 11-10 without Morant and 40-21 with him.\n\nVan Gundy said Tyus Jones is a big reason Memphis has had success without Morant. With Jones under contract for the upcoming season, that's a bonus for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"He knows when Morant comes back he's the franchise player and so I don't think that'll be a problem,\" Van Gundy said of Jones' understanding he will be just be a part-time starter until the two-time All-Star's return.\n\nBut Jones, like everything about the Grizzlies at the moment, is just a temporary solution.\n\nTheir future hinges on Morant -- the point guard with \"otherwordly talent\" -- correcting his behavior and responsibly addressing issues away from basketball.\n\nVan Gundy said supporters are hoping for a good outcome, \"but the only one in charge of that is Morant.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hubba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

          "title": "Eviction filings are 50% higher than they were pre-pandemic in some cities as rents rise",
          "body": "ATLANTA (AP) -- Entering court using a walker, a doctor's note clutched in his hand, 70-year-old Dana Williams, who suffers serious heart problems, hypertension and asthma, pleaded to delay eviction from his two-bedroom apartment in Atlanta.\n\nAlthough sympathetic, the judge said state law required him to evict Williams and his 25-year-old daughter De'mai Williams in April because they owed $8,348 in unpaid rent and fees on their $940-a-month apartment.\n\nThey have been living in limbo ever since.\n\nThey moved into a dilapidated Atlanta hotel room with water dripping through the bathroom ceiling, broken furniture and no refrigerator or microwave. But at $275-a-week, it was all they could afford on Williams' $900 monthly social security check and the $800 his daughter gets biweekly from a state agency as her father's caretaker.\n\n\"I really don't want to be here by the time his birthday comes\" in August, De'mai Williams said. \"For his health, it's just not right.\"\n\nThe Williams family is among millions of tenants from New York state to Las Vegas who have been evicted or face imminent eviction.\n\nAfter a lull during the pandemic, eviction filings by landlords have come roaring back, driven by rising rents and a long-running shortage of affordable housing. Most low-income tenants can no longer count on pandemic resources that had kept them housed, and many are finding it hard to recover because they haven't found steady work or their wages haven't kept pace with the rising cost of rent, food and other necessities.\n\nHomelessness, as a result, is rising.\n\n\"Protections have ended, the federal moratorium is obviously over, and emergency rental assistance money has dried up in most places,\" said Daniel Grubbs-Donovan, a research specialist at Princeton University's Eviction Lab.\n\n\"Across the country, low-income renters are in an even worse situation than before the pandemic due to things like massive increases in rent during the pandemic, inflation and other pandemic-era related financial difficulties.\"\n\nEviction filings are more than 50% higher than the pre-pandemic average in some cities, according to the Eviction Lab, which tracks filings in nearly three dozen cities and 10 states. Landlords file around 3.6 million eviction cases every year.\n\nAmong the hardest-hit are Houston, where rates were 56% higher in April and 50% higher in May. In Minneapolis/St. Paul, rates rose 106% in March, 55% in April and 63% in May. Nashville was 35% higher and Phoenix 33% higher in May; Rhode Island was up 32% in May.\n\nThe latest data mirrors trends that started last year, with the Eviction Lab finding nearly 970,000 evictions filed in locations it tracks -- a 78.6% increase compared to 2021, when much of the country was following an eviction moratorium. By December, eviction filings were nearly back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAt the same time, rent prices nationwide are up about 5% from a year ago and 30.5% above 2019, according to the real estate company Zillow. There are few places for displaced tenants to go, with the National Low Income Housing Coalition estimating a 7.3 million shortfall of affordable units nationwide.\n\nMany vulnerable tenants would have been evicted long ago if not for a safety net created during the pandemic.\n\nThe federal government, as well as many states and localities, issued moratoriums during the pandemic that put evictions on hold; most have now ended. There was also $46.5 billion in federal Emergency Rental Assistance that helped tenants pay rent and funded other tenant protections. Much of that has been spent or allocated, and calls for additional resources have failed to gain traction in Congress.\n\n\"The disturbing rise of evictions to pre-pandemic levels is an alarming reminder of the need for us to act -- at every level of government -- to keep folks safely housed,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, urging Congress to pass a bill cracking down on illegal evictions, fund legal help for tenants and keep evictions off credit reports.\n\nHousing courts are again filling up and ensnaring the likes of 79-year-old Maria Jackson.\n\nJackson worked for nearly two decades building a loyal clientele as a massage therapist in Las Vegas, which has seen one of the country's biggest jumps in eviction filings. That evaporated during the pandemic-triggered shutdown in March 2020. Her business fell apart; she sold her car and applied for food stamps.\n\nShe got behind on the $1,083 monthly rent on her one-bedroom apartment, and owing $12,489 in back rent was evicted in March. She moved in with a former client about an hour northeast of Las Vegas.\n\n\"Who could imagine this happening to someone who has worked all their life?\" Jackson asked.\n\nLast month she found a room in Las Vegas for $400 a month, paid for with her $1,241 monthly social security check. It's not home, but \"I'm one of the lucky ones,\" she said.\n\n\"I could be in a tent or at a shelter right now.\"\n\nIn upstate New York, evictions are rising after a moratorium lifted last year. Forty of the state's 62 counties had higher eviction filings in 2022 than before the pandemic, including two where eviction filings more than doubled compared to 2019.\n\n\"How do we care for the folks who are evicted ... when the capacity is not in place and ready to roll out in places that haven't experienced a lot of eviction recently?\" said Russell Weaver, whose Cornell University lab tracks evictions statewide.\n\nHousing advocates had hoped the Democrat-controlled state Legislature would pass a bill requiring landlords to provide justification for evicting tenants and limit rent increases to 3% or 1.5 times inflation. But it was excluded from the state budget and lawmakers failed to pass it before the legislative session ended this month.\n\n\"Our state Legislature should have fought harder,\" said Oscar Brewer, a tenant organizer facing eviction from the apartment he shares with his 6-year-old daughter in Rochester.\n\nIn Texas, evictions were kept down during the pandemic by federal assistance and the moratoriums. But as protections went away, housing prices skyrocketed in Austin, Dallas and elsewhere, leading to a record 270,000 eviction filings statewide in 2022.\n\nAdvocates were hoping the state Legislature might provide relief, directing some of the $32 billion budget surplus into rental assistance. But that hasn't happened.\n\n\"It's a huge mistake to miss our shot here,\" said Ben Martin, a research director at nonprofit Texas Housers. \"If we don't address it, now, the crisis is going to get worse.\"\n\nStill, some pandemic protections are being made permanent, and having an impact on eviction rates. Nationwide, 200 measures have passed since January 2021, including legal representation for tenants, sealing eviction records and mediation to resolve cases before they reach court, said the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nThese measures are credited with keeping eviction filings down in several cities, including New York City and Philadelphia -- 41% below pre-pandemic levels in May for the former and 33% for the latter.\n\nA right-to-counsel program and the fact that housing courts aren't prosecuting cases involving rent arears are among the factors keeping New York City filings down.\n\nIn Philadelphia, 70% of the more than 5,000 tenants and landlords who took part in the eviction diversion program resolved their cases. The city also set aside $30 million in assistance for those with less than $3,000 in arears, and started a right-to-counsel program, doubling representation rates for tenants.\n\nThe future is not so bright for Williams and his daughter, who remain stuck in their dimly-lit hotel room. Without even a microwave or nearby grocery stores, they rely on pizza deliveries and snacks from the hotel vending machine.\n\nWilliams used to love having his six grandchildren over for dinner at his old apartment, but those days are over for now.\n\n\"I just want to be able to host my grandchildren,\" he said, pausing to cough heavily. \"I just want to live somewhere where they can come and sit down and hang out with me.\"\n\nCasey reported from Boston.
